# MCP Security Review with Semgrep Rules

## Overview

This report summarizes the MCP-specific security and compatibility checks implemented for Python-based MCP repositories, based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification. The checks are designed to identify critical security and compliance issues in repo code using custom Semgrep rules.

## Security and Compatibility Checks

The following key rules have been implemented:

### 1. Missing Origin Header Validation

- **Issue:** Lack of validation for the `Origin` header can expose services to DNS rebinding attacks in HTTP transports.
- **Detection:** The rule flags endpoints that do not reference `req.headers.origin` or use a function such as `checkOrigin(...)`.
- **Severity:** ERROR


### 2. Insecure Server Binding

- **Issue:** Servers binding to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) or other non-localhost interfaces may expose them to external exploitation.
- **Detection:** The rule matches any binding to `0.0.0.0` in `app.listen`, `run`, or similar constructs, while allowing `127.0.0.1`.
- **Severity:** ERROR


### 3. Missing Authentication

- **Issue:** Absence of authentication (like API keys, tokens, certificates) can result in unauthorized access.
- **Detection:** Endpoints missing authentication logic are flagged unless they mention any of `authenticate`, `api_key`, `token`, `jwt`, or `certificate`.
- **Severity:** WARNING


### 4. Insecure Session ID Generation

- **Issue:** Session IDs generated with `random.random()` or `Math.random()` are not cryptographically secure.
- **Detection:** Rules warn unless cryptographically secure alternatives like `uuid.uuid4()`, `crypto.randomBytes`, or `secrets.token_hex` are used.
- **Severity:** ERROR


### 5. Missing SSE (Server-Sent Events) Resumption

- **Issue:** For HTTP+SSE transports, failure to implement event resumption using `Last-Event-ID` or similar approaches may break protocol compatibility.
- **Detection:** The use of `EventSource` without corresponding `Last-Event-ID` or `resume` logic is flagged.
- **Severity:** WARNING


## Example Usage Workflow

1. **Repository Review:**
    - Run the review function on the desired repo clone (e.g., `review_repo('/path/to/mcp-repo')`).
2. **Semgrep Scanning:**
    - Scanning employs the defined ruleset in `mcp-security-rules.yaml`.
    - Results are parsed and formatted, listing risks along with their file locations.
3. **Results Output:**
    - The result is a dictionary including:
        - Whether the repo passed all checks (`passes: True/False`).
        - A list of found risks and their locations, e.g.:

```
missing-origin-validation: Missing Origin header validation (potential DNS rebinding vulnerability in HTTP transports) at server.py:42
insecure-binding: Server binding to 0.0.0.0 or non-localhost (exposes to external access) at app.py:15
```

        - Errors, if any, encountered during scanning.

## Extensibility

- Additional rules can be specified for coverage including session termination, initialization, and stdio security.
- The structure allows for merging with other findings and for further customization as MCP evolves.


## Implementation Notes

- The rules are suitable for MCP repos written in Python, but the configuration also covers JavaScript, TypeScript, and Swift when adapting for cross-language audits.
- The output is tunable to organizational risk policies and broader compliance needs.

This report outlines your current Semgrep-based audit system for MCP repositories, ensuring that critical protocol security issues are automatically detected and actionable for remediation, according to the latest specification guidelines.

## Additional Checks and Gaps to Consider in MCP Semgrep Security Coverage

While your existing Semgrep rules provide robust baseline security for MCP repositories, several areas commonly recommended in secure protocol and cloud application reviews are not yet addressed. Expanding your ruleset in the following ways will bring coverage closer to leading standards and increase both breadth and depth.

### 1. Session and Credential Termination

- **Missing Coverage:** No explicit checks for proper session termination (e.g., logout endpoints, token revocation).
- **Suggested Rule:** Identify the absence of session destruction mechanisms (like deleting session cookies or tokens) after use.
- **Why Needed:** Prevents persistent sessions from being hijacked or reused.


### 2. Secure Initialization \& Defaults

- **Missing Coverage:** Checks for unsafe defaults or missing explicit initialization functions are not present.
- **Suggested Rule:** Flag use of default/guessable secrets, open CORS without restrictions, or modules accepting broad permissions by default.


### 3. Standard Input/Output (Stdio) Risks

- **Missing Coverage:** Rules do not detect use of potentially unsafe `input()`, `eval()`, or deserialization from untrusted sources.
- **Suggested Rule:** Identify dangerous uses of `eval`, direct shell calls, `pickle.loads`, or subprocesses sourced from network input.


### 4. Transport Layer Security (TLS/HTTPS)

- **Missing Coverage:** No checks on whether network transports use plain HTTP rather than HTTPS, or weak TLS configurations.
- **Suggested Rule:** Detect endpoints initialized without TLS; warn for use of `verify=False` in Python requests or equivalent.


### 5. Sensitive Data Exposure

- **Missing Coverage:** Existing rules do not scan for logging or transmitting secrets, API keys, or tokens in logs or responses.
- **Suggested Rule:** Identify code paths where secrets might get logged or sent in error/response messages.


### 6. Rate Limiting and Resource Exhaustion

- **Missing Coverage:** There are no rules confirming the presence of rate limiting or abuse controls on endpoints.
- **Suggested Rule:** Warn if request handlers lack any rate-limiting decorators, middleware, or header-based protections.


### 7. Authorization Granularity

- **Missing Coverage:** While authentication is checked, there are no rules confirming fine-grained authorization (access control/role checks).
- **Suggested Rule:** Identify routes or methods missing checks for user roles, scopes, or permissions.


### 8. Dependency and Supply Chain Security

- **Missing Coverage:** No automated scan for vulnerable libraries or non-pinned dependencies.
- **Suggested Rule:** Identify use of outdated packages or calls to install dependencies without fixed versions (e.g., `requirements.txt` entries lacking version constraints).


### 9. Protocol Compliance and Nonces

- **Missing Coverage:** For protocols like MCP, rules should ensure compliance with requirements such as unique nonces, timestamps, or replay protection where relevant.
- **Suggested Rule:** Warn if requests or responses do not generate and validate unique, cryptographically secure nonces.


## Summary Table of Missing or Underrepresented Controls

| Area | Description of Missed Coverage | Security Impact |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Session Termination | Lack of checks for logout/revoke | Session/token hijacking |
| Initialization/Defaults | Unsafe defaults or missing explicit inits | Broad attack surface |
| Stdio Risks | Dangerous uses of `input()`, `eval()`, `pickle` | RCE, data corruption |
| Transport Layer Security | Use of HTTP or weak TLS settings | Data interception |
| Sensitive Data Exposure | Logging/transmission of secrets | Credential leakage |
| Rate Limiting | Absence of resource/abuse protections | DoS/brute force |
| Authorization Granularity | Lack of access control checks | Privilege escalation |
| Dependency Security | Non-pinned/vulnerable libraries | Supply chain risk |
| Protocol Compliance/Nonces | Missing replay/nonce/timestamp protections | Protocol compromise |

### Next Steps

- Review each gap and, if critical to your application or compliance goals, draft and test corresponding Semgrep rule(s).
- Cross-check the MCP specification for any additional protocol-mandated checks unique to your ecosystem.
- Consider automating dependency checks using tools like `pip-audit`, `poetry check`, or similar as part of your pipeline.

Addressing these areas will help ensure your MCP repositories achieve a more comprehensive standard of security and protocol compliance.

    metadata:
      category: security
      references: ["https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic"]
```


## 7. Supply Chain \& Dependency Security

Detect use of unpinned dependencies and direct calls to `pip` in code, per best practices around minimizing supply chain risk[^3_3].

```yaml
  - id: mcp-supplychain-deps
    message: "Dependency/version not pinned or pip install triggered from within code."
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [python]
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          subprocess.run(["pip", "install", ...])
      - pattern: |
          requirements.txt:$PKG\n
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          requirements.txt:$PKG==$VER\n
    metadata:
      category: supply-chain
      references: ["https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic"]
```


## 8. Insecure Session ID Generation

Detect insecure random generators for session IDs or tokens[^3_3].

    metadata:
      category: security
      references: ["https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic"]
```


## 9. Origin Header and Host Validation

Check for missing `Origin`/`Host` validation in HTTP handler logic, following anti-CSRF/DNS rebinding guidance[^3_1].

```yaml
  - id: mcp-missing-origin-validation
    message: "Missing Origin/Host validation (potential DNS rebinding vulnerability)."
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [python]
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          @app.route(...)
          def $FUNC(...):
              ...
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          ..."Origin" in request.headers...

          ...check_origin...
    metadata:
      category: security
      references: ["https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic"]
```


## 10. Explicit User Consent Before Sensitive Actions

Warn on execution of any action on behalf of a user without a preceding explicit consent check (such as an interactive prompt, UI confirmation, or `confirm_...` method)[^3_1].

```yaml
  - id: mcp-explicit-user-consent
    message: "Action performed on user data without explicit consent/confirmation."
    severity: WARNING
    languages: [python]
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          def $FUNC(...):
              ...
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          ...if confirm_user_consent()...
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          ...if ui.prompt("...")...
    metadata:
      category: privacy
      references: ["https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic"]
```


## Usage

- Save this YAML in a `.yaml` file.
- Run Semgrep on your Python MCP repo:
`semgrep scan --config <your-file.yaml> <repo-dir>`

These rules will help MCP implementers meet both the letter and intent of the 2025-03-26 protocol spec and subpages, strengthening your code’s security posture and compliance with mandatory and recommended practices[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3][^3_4].

# instead of severity error make it an appropiate severity

Absolutely. Below is the updated **Semgrep rule set for MCP-compliant Python code**, where each rule now uses an appropriate `severity` level—`INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`—based on the **risk impact** and **guidance severity** suggested in the [MCP 2025-03-26 Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic).

### ✅ Summary of Severity Levels

| Rule ID | Severity | Rationale |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| mcp-missing-auth | `ERROR` | Without authz/authn, endpoints are fully exposed |
| mcp-insecure-transport | `ERROR` | Plain HTTP or verify=False breaks secure channel assumption |
| mcp-sensitive-data-logging | `ERROR` | Leaking secrets harshly violates protocol and privacy boundaries |
| mcp-insecure-deserialization | `ERROR` | RCE risk—immediate vulnerability |
| mcp-missing-session-termination | `WARNING` | Important best practice, though not immediately exploitable |
| mcp-missing-rate-limit | `WARNING` | Encouraged to mitigate abuse; part of threat model |
| mcp-supplychain-deps | `WARNING` | Risk grows over time via drift or outdated packages |
| mcp-insecure-session-id | `ERROR` | Violates session integrity/confidentiality |
| mcp-missing-origin-validation | `ERROR` | Directly exploitable via DNS rebinding |
| mcp-explicit-user-consent | `WARNING` | Privacy/UX best practice per spec, not always critical |

### 📦 Usage

Save the file as `mcp-python-rules.yaml`, then scan your MCP repo with:

```bash
semgrep scan --config=mcp-python-rules.yaml <path-to-repo>
```

This updated ruleset aligns with risk priority levels recommended by the Model Context Protocol and modern application security guidance. Let me know if you'd like a version of this converted to JSON or tailored for another language (e.g., JavaScript, Swift)!

## Severity for Missing Authentication or Authorization Controls

### Context

The rule:

```yaml
- id: mcp-missing-auth
  message: "MCP endpoint lacks authentication or role-based access control (RBAC)."
  severity: ERROR  # User is asking if this should be 'ERROR' or 'CRITICAL'
```


### Should This Be "ERROR" or "CRITICAL"?

Modern security classification for findings generally considers the following:

- **CRITICAL** is reserved for vulnerabilities that:
    - Are trivially and remotely exploitable.
    - Allow immediate, unauthenticated, and complete compromise of highly sensitive systems or data, or provide unrestricted administrative access.
    - Require urgent, emergency response—incidents that, if found, typically justify disabling the affected system until fixed.
- **ERROR** (or "High Severity") flags very serious security issues that require prompt remediation but might have at least some mitigating controls, context, or require additional steps post-exploitation.


### Analysis for MCP Authentication/Authorization Gaps

- **Missing authentication or RBAC on an endpoint means**:
    - Any client, including an attacker, may access, modify, or disrupt the service or data—potentially including sensitive operations.
    - This is often considered a high-severity (ERROR) finding in most audit systems, but not always the absolute most urgent (CRITICAL) unless the affected endpoint is also highly privileged, internet-exposed, and contains sensitive data or operations.
    - Many compliance and regulatory standards recommend *critical* only for direct, confirmed exposure or exploitation risk across the most sensitive environments.


### Industry Practice

- Most security scanning tools and industry guidance (including Semgrep best practices) categorize missing authentication as "ERROR" (high) rather than "CRITICAL", unless your internal risk policy is extremely strict or your exposed endpoints directly handle critical infrastructure, user credentials, or financial transactions.
- The MCP protocol documentation treats authentication as absolutely required for secure operation, but stops short of requiring "critical" severity—it stresses mandatory controls and remediation but avoids the language of operational emergency.


### Recommendation

- **"ERROR"** is an appropriate and correct default severity for missing authentication or authorization controls in your Semgrep rule set.
- Reserve **"CRITICAL"** for situations where additional evidence shows direct, active exploitation or immediate multi-system compromise is possible.


#### Table: Severity Level Decision

| Rule Scenario | Recommended Severity |
| :-- | :-- |
| Missing auth/RBAC, general endpoints | ERROR |
| Missing auth/RBAC on privileged/admin APIs, internet-exposed, and unlogged | CRITICAL (optional, based on policy) |
| Auth present but bypassable (e.g., hardcoded credentials, logic flaw) | ERROR/CRITICAL (case by case) |

**Summary:**
For "MCP endpoint lacks authentication or role-based access control (RBAC)", "**ERROR**" is the industry-standard and protocol-aligned severity—set "CRITICAL" only if your risk policy defines such cases as requiring emergency action and you have high-confidence the impact meets the stricter bar.

## Semgrep Severity Levels: High, Medium, Low

You can absolutely use `high`, `medium`, and `low` as severity levels in your Semgrep rules. Semgrep supports four standard severity values for rules:

- **critical**
- **high**
- **medium**
- **low**

These values are accepted in the `severity` field of each rule in the YAML configuration and are used throughout Semgrep’s documentation and reporting outputs. This provides clearer mapping to industry-standard risk language and lets you rank findings by their urgency and potential business impact[^6_1][^6_2][^6_3][^6_4].

### How to Configure Severities

In your Semgrep rule YAML, simply set:

```yaml
severity: high    # or 'medium', 'low', or 'critical'
```

For example:

```yaml
- id: mcp-missing-auth
  message: "MCP endpoint lacks authentication or role-based access control (RBAC)."
  severity: high
  languages: [python]
  ...
```


### Severity Mapping Reference

| Severity | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| critical | Urgent: Immediate action required, broad compromise possible |
| high | Very serious risk, but not always catastrophic |
| medium | Moderate risk or best practice violation |
| low | Low-impact finding, informational |

### Summary

Replace `ERROR` with `high` (or `medium`/`low` as appropriate) in your Semgrep rules for clearer, modern severity assignment. This aligns your rules with best practice and makes the output more intuitive for teams reviewing results[^6_1][^6_2][^6_3][^6_4].

# give me the rules again wth right severity wording

Here is the **full Semgrep rule set for MCP Python repositories**, updated to use standardized **severity levels**: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, and `low` — replacing `ERROR`/`WARNING`/`INFO` from earlier versions.

This reflects priority based on risk and importance per the [Model Context Protocol Specification (2025-03-26)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic) and standard security practices.

# yes and GO

Absolutely! Here's the **Go (Golang)** version of the MCP security Semgrep rules — fully adapted from the [Model Context Protocol Specification (2025-03-26)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic) — with correct `severity` values (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) and matched to common patterns in Go web/API development, such as:

- `net/http` handlers
- `echo`, `gin`, `fiber` frameworks
- HTTP server initialization
- Token/session management
- Data serialization

| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| mcp-go-missing-auth | `high` | Auth/rbac missing = unauthorized control |
| mcp-go-insecure-transport | `high` | TLS not required |
| mcp-go-sensitive-data-exposure | `high` | Secrets logged/exposed |
| mcp-go-insecure-deserialization | `critical` | RCE/injection-like deserialization |
| mcp-go-missing-session-termination | `medium` | Revocation/termination not enforced |
| mcp-go-missing-rate-limit | `medium` | Path can be DoS’d or abused |
| mcp-go-insecure-session-id | `critical` | IDs generated using math/rand = guessable |
| mcp-go-missing-origin-check | `high` | DNS rebinding/cross-origin exploits possible |
| mcp-go-missing-user-consent | `medium` | No user interaction for sensitive operation |
| mcp-go-unpinned-dependency | `medium` | Use of `latest` in `go.mod` can lead to supply chain compromise |

Let me know if you’d like custom rules for specific Go frameworks like **Gin**, **Echo**, **Fiber**, or lower-level packages like `fasthttp` — or if you’d like to consolidate Go + Python rules into a unified config!

# Semgrep Rule Set for MCP-Compliant JavaScript Code

Below are ready-to-use Semgrep rules tailored for JavaScript and Node.js code implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) guidelines, based on the official MCP specification and established security best practices. Each rule uses the standardized severity levels (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) to help prioritize findings.

    references: [
      "https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/supply-chain"
    ]
```


## How to Use

1. Save these rules to a file, e.g., `mcp-js-rules.yaml`.
2. Run on your repo:

```sh
semgrep scan --config=mcp-js-rules.yaml /path/to/js-or-ts-project
```


These rules will help enforce MCP protocol compliance and raise automated alerts for most high-risk and recommended controls in JavaScript-based MCP implementations. For advanced coverage, consider supplementing with the official Semgrep registry or extending to TypeScript for full-stack projects[^9_1][^9_2][^9_3].

# MCP \& Semgrep Security Scoring Methodology (FICO-like Model)

This methodology outlines an objective, FICO-style scoring system for evaluating a codebase using Semgrep—combining custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) rules and any additional rules triggered in a typical Semgrep scan. Scores represent security posture, with higher scores reflecting better compliance and lower risk.

## 1. Score Range \& Interpretation

| Score Range | Security Level | Interpretation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 800–900 | Excellent | No critical/high issues; strong best practices |
| 740–799 | Very Good | Isolated medium issues, no critical |
| 670–739 | Good | Limited high/critical, some medium |
| 580–669 | Fair | Multiple high/critical; medium issues present |
| 300–579 | Poor | Systemic security gaps; urgent remediation |

## 2. Rule Severity Weighting

Each finding detected by Semgrep is assigned a baseline weight based on severity:


| Severity | Point Deduction per Finding |
| :-- | :-- |
| critical | -120 |
| high | -80 |
| medium | -40 |
| low | -10 |

## 3. MCP Rule Adjustment

Findings from key MCP rules receive an extra deduction, recognizing the heightened importance of protocol-critical controls:

- **For each MCP-specific “critical” or “high” severity finding:** additional -40 points per finding.
- **For MCP “medium” findings:** additional -20 points.
- **If the same finding is triggered both by a generic and MCP rule:** only the highest penalty applies (no double deduction).


## 4. Scoring Formula

- Base score: **900**
- For each finding, subtract according to the table above.
- Apply MCP adjustment for any rule IDs matching the MCP ruleset.
- Minimum score: **300**
- If >10 findings at “critical” or “high” severity, cap score at **579** (“Poor”).

**Example Calculation:**

Suppose a repo has:

- 1 MCP critical finding
(-120 - 40 = -160)
- 2 generic high findings
(-80 × 2 = -160)
- 3 medium findings (one MCP)
(-40 × 3 = -120; one is also MCP so extra -20 = -140 total for medium)
- 2 low findings
(-10 × 2 = -20)

**Score:**
900 – 160 – 160 – 140 – 20 = **420** (Fair)

## 5. Bonus Points

To reward exceeding compliance:

- If a repository contains zero findings from MCP rules and no “critical” or “high” severity in all findings, add **+20** bonus points (max cap 900).
- If the repo exceeds 80% code coverage with positive tests specifically checking for MCP controls, add **+20** bonus.


## 6. Reporting

The scoring breakdown should be included alongside the listing of findings, e.g.:


| Severity | MCP Rule | Count | Points Deducted |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| critical | Yes | 1 | -160 |
| high | No | 2 | -160 |
| medium | 1 x MCP | 3 | -140 |
| low | No | 2 | -20 |
| **TOTAL** |  |  | **-480** |

**Final Score:** 900 – 480 = **420**

## 7. Score Usage

- **800–900:** Approve for production use
- **670–799:** Minor remediation before approval
- **580–669:** Targeted remediation; management review
- **300–579:** Major remediation; block release

This approach ensures security review outputs are consistent, evidence-driven, and easy to interpret for both technical and compliance stakeholders.

# MCP \& Semgrep Security Scoring Methodology (FICO-Max 850)

To align your Semgrep-driven security scoring with a FICO-style range where the maximum score is **850**, use the following revised model:

## Score Range and Meaning

| Score Range | Security Level | Interpretation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 800–850 | Excellent | No critical/high issues; strong best practices |
| 740–799 | Very Good | Isolated medium issues, no critical |
| 670–739 | Good | Limited high/critical, some medium |
| 580–669 | Fair | Multiple high/critical; medium issues present |
| 300–579 | Poor | Systemic security gaps; urgent remediation |

## Rule Severity Weighting

Each Semgrep finding deducts points from the **base score of 850** according to severity:


| Severity | Point Deduction per Finding |
| :-- | :-- |
| critical | -110 |
| high | -70 |
| medium | -35 |
| low | -10 |

## MCP Rule Adjustment

To emphasize protocol-critical controls:

- **Each MCP-specific “critical” or “high” severity finding:** extra -35 points per.
- **Each MCP “medium”:** extra -15 points per.
- *If both generic and MCP rules fire on the same finding, only the highest penalty applies.*


## Scoring Formula

- **Start at 850**
- Subtract per finding (see above)
- Deduct MCP adjustment per qualifying finding
- Minimum floor: **300**
- If over 10 “critical” or “high” findings, set score to **579** (“Poor”)


### Example Calculation

A repo yields:

- 1 MCP critical finding
(-110 - 35 = -145)
- 2 generic high findings
(-70 × 2 = -140)
- 3 medium findings (one MCP)
(-35 × 3 = -105, one is also MCP so extra -15 = -120 total for medium)
- 2 low findings
(-10 × 2 = -20)

**Score:**
850 – 145 – 140 – 120 – 20 = **425** (“Fair”)

## Bonus Points

- No MCP findings and no “critical” or “high” overall: **+15** (max cap 850)
- Over 80% coverage in positive security/MCP tests: **+15** (cap 850)


## Score Reporting Table Example

| Severity | MCP Rule | Count | Points Deducted |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| critical | Yes | 1 | -145 |
| high | No | 2 | -140 |
| medium | 1 x MCP | 3 | -120 |
| low | No | 2 | -20 |
| **TOTAL** |  |  | **-425** |

**Final Score:** 850 – 425 = **425**

## Score Interpretation and Use

- **800–850**: Production-ready, excellent protocol/enterprise posture.
- **670–799**: Minor remediation only.
- **580–669**: Targeted remediation required; management review.
- **300–579**: Major remediation; block release.

This FICO-style scoring delivers clear, comparable assessment for MCP and broader Semgrep findings across your codebase.

# Give me developer document

Certainly! Here’s a developer-facing **Semgrep Security Scoring Documentation** for MCP codebases, clearly explaining your FICO-like approach, what developers need to do, how findings are scored, and what their score means.

# MCP Semgrep Security Scoring – Developer Document

## Overview

This document explains how the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Security Score** is computed for your repository using Semgrep scans, what influences your score, and how you can improve it.

The scoring methodology is modeled on the well-known **FICO score range (300–850)**, making it easy to interpret your codebase’s trustworthiness at a glance.

## Table of Contents

2. [Score Calculation](#score-calculation)
3. [Result Interpretation](#result-interpretation)
4. [How to Improve Your Score](#how-to-improve-your-score)
5. [Running Semgrep and Viewing Your Score](#running-semgrep-and-viewing-your-score)
6. [FAQ](#faq)

## What Is Scored?

When you run a Semgrep scan on your MCP repository, the following are detected and scored:

- **MCP-Specific Security Rules:** Core rules derived from [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic) (e.g., missing authentication, insecure origins, weak session IDs, unsafe serialization).
- **General Semgrep Security Rules:** Any additional rules you include or that are found in your codebase (e.g., third-party dependencies, use of deprecated APIs).

Each security issue found is counted and categorized by severity: **critical, high, medium, or low**.

## Score Calculation

Your project begins with a **perfect score of 850**. Deductions are made based on findings and their severity.


| Severity | Points Lost per Finding | Additional Penalty for MCP Rule? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| critical | –110 | –35 |
| high | –70 | –35 |
| medium | –35 | –15 |
| low | –10 | None |

**If the same issue is flagged by both generic and MCP-specific rules, only the highest penalty is applied.**

Example:

- 1 critical finding from an MCP rule → (–110) –35 = **–145**
- 2 high (not MCP) findings      → 2 × (–70) = **–140**
- 3 medium findings (one is MCP) → 3 × (–35) + (–15) = **–120**
- 2 low findings                 → 2 × (–10) = **–20**
- **Total: 850 – 145 – 140 – 120 – 20 = 425**


### Bonus Points

- **+15**: No critical or high severity findings, and no MCP findings.
- **+15**: >80% test coverage for MCP-required security behaviors.

**Maximum score remains capped at 850.**

### Score Floor

- Your score never drops below **300**.
- If you have more than 10 “critical” or “high” findings, your score is capped at **579 (“Poor”)** until those are fixed.


## Result Interpretation

| Score Range | Security Level | What it Means | Action Needed |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 800–850 | Excellent | Secure, protocol-compliant | Ship! |
| 740–799 | Very Good | Minor non-blocking issues | Fix soon |
| 670–739 | Good | Improvement needed | Remediate proactively |
| 580–669 | Fair | Multiple serious risks | Management review, fix |
| 300–579 | Poor | Serious or systemic gaps | Block release, remediate |

## How to Improve Your Score

- **Fix all “critical” and “high” findings** first—they have the biggest impact.
- **Review and fix MCP rule violations** (see output for ruleIDs starting with `mcp-`).
- **Update dependencies and pin their versions.**
- **Add test coverage for security features** (e.g., test missing authentication, insecure session IDs, etc.).
- **Avoid using dangerous APIs** (`eval`, `pickle`, `Math.random`, etc.).
- **Ensure explicit user consent where required.**

Your latest security score and all rule violations will be shown with each scan, including helpful links and code locations.

## Running Semgrep and Viewing Your Score

1. Make sure you have [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) installed.
2. Run the MCP rules (and any other security rules):

```bash
semgrep scan --config=mcp-python-rules.yaml .
```

_(For JS/Go, use the corresponding MCP rules file.)_
3. Review the scan output, which will show:
    - All findings by severity (with MCP-specific findings clearly marked)
    - Your computed security score
    - The breakdown of deductions and advice on how to improve
4. Address findings and re-run until your score meets your project standards.

## FAQ

**Q: Why does an MCP rule cost more points than a generic rule?**
A: MCP rules enforce core protocol safety—violations are most likely to result in real-world security breaches or compliance gaps.

**Q: What if a finding seems like a false positive?**
A: Carefully review flagged code. If genuinely safe, you may add a Semgrep ignore comment and ask for a security review.

**Q: How do I get bonus points?**
A: Ensure you have thorough security-related test coverage and no major findings.

**Q: How strict should we be?**
A: Shipping is only recommended with a score above 800, and with all critical and high issues addressed.

**For further guidance, see**:

- MCP Protocol Specification: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic
- Your language’s MCP Semgrep rules: check your project’s `/semgrep/` directory
- [Semgrep Documentation](https://semgrep.dev/docs/)

**Security Score = 850 – (critical/high/medium/low deductions) – (MCP penalties) + (bonus points)**

Use your score to drive continuous improvement—**aim for 800+ and zero critical/high findings before every release!**

## Should MCP Security Scoring Adjust for MCP Role or Integration Context?

### Overview

Yes, you should consider adjusting your MCP security scoring methodology based on the **role and integration context** of the MCP implementation. The protocol role (and the criticality of the integrated system) directly affects the **security impact** of any weaknesses and therefore the urgency and priority of remediation.

### Why Role-Based Adjustment Matters

- **Risk Profile Differences:**
An MCP that mediates design tools like Figma (typically less sensitive operational data, often used internally) will not always have the same risk consequences as an MCP interfacing with a data warehouse like Snowflake (which may contain sensitive business data, PII, or regulated information).
- **Exposure Scope:**
Integrations touching production data, financial records, or customer PII demand more stringent controls than those serving purely internal, sandbox, or demo environments.
- **MCP Role Examples:**
    - **Data platform (e.g., Snowflake):**
        - Data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or regulatory exposure can have direct business consequences.
        - Requires strict authentication, logging, data minimization, and often compliance (PCI, SOC2, GDPR) alignment.
    - **Collaboration/UI tools (e.g., Figma):**
        - Business impact is lower, but session hijacking or account theft may still be significant.
        - May tolerate some medium-risk issues in test or limited-access environments.


### Approaches for Role-Based Adjustment

#### 1. **Weighted Deduction/Multiplier**

- Assign a **risk multiplier** to findings based on an assigned risk tier (“critical platform,” “core business data,” “peripheral tool,” etc.).
    - E.g., critical/high findings in a Snowflake MCP receive 1.5x deduction; in a Figma MCP, base deduction applies.


#### 2. **Role Tagging in Semgrep Rules**

- Extend MCP rules with metadata tags such as `mcp_role: data-warehouse` or `mcp_role: design-tool`.
- Your scoring logic references these tags for context-specific adjustments.


#### 3. **Tiered Minimum Score Thresholds**

- For high-criticality roles: Require 800+ score and zero critical/high findings.
- For less critical roles: Allow 740+ and tolerate some medium findings if justified by compensating controls.


#### 4. **Risk-Based Remediation Matrix**

| MCP Integration | Example System | Required Score | Tolerances | Typical Multiplier |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Data/Finance Platform | Snowflake | 820+ | None | 1.5x on all high/critical |
| Core SaaS Integration | Salesforce | 800+ | Max 1 high | 1.2x on high |
| Collaboration/UI Tool | Figma | 740+ | Max 2 med | Standard deductions |
| Internal/Test Utility | Custom | 670+ | Some med | 0.8x (less strict) |

### Recommendations

- **Document MCP roles for each integration** and assign default risk tiers at project kickoff.
- **Apply the most stringent scoring requirements** to integrations handling sensitive data, financial systems, or production infrastructure.
- **Review and adjust thresholds periodically**—your scoring should reflect the highest risk posed by any integration in production.


### Summary

For fair, risk-informed governance, you should absolutely **adjust Semgrep/MCP scoring based on each MCP’s role and the criticality of its integration context**. This ensures remediation and escalation efforts are right-sized to actual business consequences, rather than one-size-fits-all.

---

# How do we identify role?

You **identify the role** of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) component by understanding its specific position and responsibilities in the MCP architecture—namely whether it is acting as a **Host**, **Client**, or **Server**, and further, by what system or data domain the integration targets (for example, a SaaS design tool like Figma vs. a data warehouse like Snowflake).

### Core MCP Roles, per Specification

According to the official [MCP specification][^14_1][^14_2][^14_4][^14_5][^14_6]:


| Term | What It Is | Responsibilities | Example (Context) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Host** | The LLM application | Initiates MCP connections, manages clients, coordinates security and context handling | Claude Desktop, IDE, chat UI |
| **Client** | Connector within a host | Translates host requirements to protocol, manages communication with a server | Plugin inside a host app |
| **Server** | External tool/data service/resource | Provides tools, resources, and/or prompts via MCP, exposes core API endpoints | MCP server for Figma, Snowflake, GitHub |

**Servers** are especially important when discussing “integration role.”

### How Do You Determine Role in Real Projects?

#### 1. **Documented Meta/Config Data**

- Most MCP implementations (server/client) include a configuration/manifest file that declares:
    - **Type:** Is this process a host, client, or server?
    - **Integration Target:** What product, API, or domain is this server built for? (E.g., “Snowflake,” “Figma”)
- There is movement in the community toward an [MCP registry of integrations][^14_2]; such a registry would formally classify each integration’s domain.


#### 2. **Review of Capabilities or Features**

- Analyze the **“Tools”**, **“Resources”**, or **“Prompts”** exposed by a server, as indicated in the MCP spec[^14_1][^14_4][^14_5]:
    - If `tools` run mutations on sensitive data, it’s likely tied to a database or critical API.
    - If `resources` are files or direct design assets, probably a design tool or file management system.


#### 3. **Connection and Message Patterns**

- **Clients** initiate connections to **servers**.
- **Servers** respond to MCP query/call requests with capabilities and data.
- Host applications coordinate multiple clients and enforce session or user policies.


#### 4. **Explicit Integration Label**

- Many integrations self-describe their context in configuration:

```json
// Example MCP server config
{
  "role": "server",
  "integration_target": "snowflake",
  "capabilities": ["runQuery", "listTables", "downloadResults"]
}
```


#### 5. **Deployment and Access Patterns**

- **Servers** that are deployed to handle production data—especially those integrated with enterprise SaaS, databases, or finance—are considered “critical integration” roles.
- Those linked to development tools or design assets may be marked as “collaboration/UI” roles.


### Practical Steps for Identification

1. **Inspect configuration files** (manifest, package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.) for “role” and “integration” keys.
2. **Review public documentation/readme** for the MCP package or server—these often state the target integration and intended usage.
3. **Map endpoint/capability names** to common domains (e.g., “query,” “table,” “db” = database; “frame,” “asset,” “component” = design tool).
4. **Check contextual metadata** (if published to a registry or marketplace, see its category/tag).
5. **Discuss with integration owner** (if uncertain).

### Why Role Identification Matters

- **Risk and Security Scoring**: A server connected to sensitive data (e.g., Snowflake) should be subject to stricter controls and scoring penalties than one managing low-risk assets (e.g., Figma).
- **Policy Enforcement**: Determines config, deployment, secrets, exposure, and audit requirements.
- **Auditability**: Correctly classified roles streamline risk assessment and compliance checks.

**Summary Table: Identification Cues**


| Identification Strategy | Example |
| :-- | :-- |
| Config/manifest fields | `role: server`, `integration: snowflake` |
| Capability keywords | `runQuery` (database), `exportFrame` (design) |
| Documentation/readme | "MCP server for [X]" |
| Registry/marketplace tag | Category: "data warehouse" |
| Deployment notes | Used in prod data pipelines |

# Can Gemini Identify Cheaply?

## Summary

Google's Gemini AI family has been specifically engineered to deliver cost-effective AI identification and reasoning, especially with its Flash and Flash-Lite models. These models allow developers and organizations to make use of sophisticated AI at dramatically lower costs compared to previous offerings and many competitors.

## Cheap Identification with Gemini: How It Works

- **Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite** are optimized for affordability and speed. They are smaller than the flagship Ultra model, meaning lower compute requirements and reduced costs. For example, Gemini 2.0 Flash processes data and provides identifications at a fraction of the price of larger models[^15_1][^15_2].
    - *Sample pricing*: Around \$0.10–\$0.15 per million input tokens and \$0.40–\$0.60 per million output tokens for standard operations. Flash-Lite goes as low as \$0.019 per million tokens, undercutting many competitors[^15_1][^15_2][^15_3].
- Costs can be kept low by tailoring queries and processing to the model tier best suited for the use case—routine or simple identification tasks can use Flash or Flash-Lite, reserving Ultra or Pro versions for more demanding analysis[^15_2].
- **Reasoning complexity affects cost**: The more complex the identification (e.g., multi-step reasoning, nuanced classification), the more tokens are processed, with advanced reasoning costing more per output token. However, users can set a “thinking budget” to control reasoning complexity and manage expenses[^15_3].
- **Real-world example**: Gemini can be used for economical identification tasks such as searching for cheap flights, filtering content, or extracting information from large datasets. Developers pay only for the amount of data (tokens) processed, making identification tasks scalable and affordable for both businesses and individuals[^15_4][^15_5][^15_6].


## Features Enhancing Cost-Efficiency

- **Native tool use**: Gemini models, including Flash, can leverage Google’s APIs and search directly within applications, increasing identification speed and lowering operational costs[^15_1].
- **Multi-modal input**: Gemini can efficiently process not only text but also images, audio, and video, which makes it versatile for identification tasks across different data types[^15_7][^15_5].
- **Cloud cost control**: On platforms like Vertex AI, users can monitor and group Gemini-related costs by model, team, or operation for optimal budgeting. Third-party tools (e.g., Vantage) further enhance visibility and optimization[^15_8][^15_9][^15_10].


## Table: Gemini Model Identification Prices (indicative)

| Model | Input Cost per 1M tokens | Output Cost per 1M tokens | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Flash | \$0.10–\$0.15 | \$0.40–\$0.60 | Cheapest, fast, suitable for most tasks |
| Flash-Lite | \$0.019 | Not specified | Ultra-low cost, basic identification |
| 2.5 Flash (reasoning)* | Variable (\$3.50/output 1M tokens if deep reasoning) | More for complex reasoning | User can set “thinking budget” |
| Pro/Ultra | Higher than Flash | Higher than Flash | Better for advanced/critical use cases |

\* Reasoning complexity increases cost per output token[^15_3][^15_2][^15_6].

## Conclusion

Gemini models, particularly Flash and Flash-Lite, are designed for low-cost identification and basic reasoning. They are among the most competitively priced mainstream AI offerings, and costs can be strictly managed by model choice and configuration. For advanced identification, costs rise but remain market-competitive, with clear transparency and budgeting features available to users[^15_1][^15_2][^15_3][^15_8].

**In short: Gemini can identify cheaply—especially when using the Flash and Flash-Lite models for routine and scalable tasks.**

# Key Files for MCP Repo Role Identification

When trying to programmatically determine the **role** of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) repository—such as whether it acts as a Host, Client, or Server, or discover which external system it targets—certain configuration and manifest files are especially useful. These files can be sent to Gemini or another reasoning API to infer the MCP integration role.

## Common Files Found in MCP Repos

| File Name / Path | Typical Content \& Purpose | Relevance for Role Detection |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `mcp.json` | Main MCP configuration (role, integration target, commands) | **HIGH** — often explicitly states role, commands, and integration[^16_1][^16_2] |
| `tool-manifest.json` or `manifest.json` | MCP tool manifest: lists tools, capabilities, and external targets | **HIGH** — describes capabilities and target domains[^16_3][^16_4] |
| `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/`go.mod` | May include MCP-related keywords, role, dependencies | **Medium** — can hint at target or type |
| `README.md` or docs | Project description, usually names the integration target | **Medium** — good for natural language extraction |
| `.vscode/mcp.json` | VS Code configuration for MCP servers/clients | **HIGH** — common in developer-facing projects[^16_2] |
| `.amazonq/mcp.json` | Amazon Q Dev config, if relevant | **High** — structure similar to standard MCP config[^16_1] |
| `devcontainer.json` | Dev container setups specifying MCP servers | Medium |
| `mcp-registry/` | Registry entry for MCP integration, if public | Medium |

## Minimum Recommended Files to Send for Role Analysis

If your goal is to reliably let Gemini (or any strong LLM) deduce the MCP repository's role:

- **Always include (if present):**
    - `mcp.json`
    - `tool-manifest.json` or `manifest.json`
    - `.vscode/mcp.json` or `.amazonq/mcp.json`
- **Add for additional context (if needed):**
    - `README.md`
    - Directory-level manifest from `mcp-registry/` (if public/open)
    - Any server configuration files (e.g., for container, cloud, custom)


## Example: `mcp.json` Structure

A typical `mcp.json` could look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "snowflake": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["main.py"],
      "integration_target": "snowflake",
      "role": "server",
      "capabilities": ["runQuery", "listTables"]
    }
  }
}
```

This example directly exposes the integration target and role[^16_1][^16_2].

## Why These Files Work

- **Direct self-description:** Most MCP repos include machine-readable config files that list their role and the external system or data they serve.
- **Required by tooling:** Developer tools (e.g., VS Code, Amazon Q) and registries standardize on these file names and fields for MCP integrations[^16_1][^16_2].
- **Manifest-driven:** The MCP tool manifest or registry entry is specifically designed for programmatic discovery of role and capabilities[^16_3][^16_4].


## Summary Table: Role-Detection File Checklist

| Check for Presence in Repo | Priority for Role Detection |
| :-- | :-- |
| `mcp.json` (root or config folder) | Essential |
| `tool-manifest.json` / `manifest.json` | Essential |
| `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.amazonq/mcp.json` | High |
| `README.md` | Optional/natural language |
| `devcontainer.json`, registry docs | Supplemental |

## References

- Tool manifest and purpose: [Secoda][^16_3], [LobeHub][^16_4]
- VS Code usage (mcp.json): [VS Code Docs][^16_2]
- MCP architecture overview: [Descope][^16_5], [Philschmid][^16_6]

**In summary:**
Yes, there are **specific files every well-formed MCP repo is likely to have**—primarily `mcp.json` and `tool-manifest.json` (plus VS Code or registry configs)—that can be supplied to Gemini via API to reliably infer role and integration target[^16_1][^16_3][^16_2][^16_4]. If absent, project documentation (`README.md`) and main manifest (`manifest.json`) are good fallbacks for extraction.

## MCP Missing Authentication and Claude Integration: Is the Assumption Correct?

### Context

- Many Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients are designed to work primarily as plugins or external connections within AI hosts like Claude.
- These MCP components often inherit environment details (API keys, organization context, permissions) directly from the Claude host environment, rather than implementing standalone authentication layers themselves.


### Analysis

**Your assumption is generally correct, but with important caveats:**

- **Inherited Authentication Context:**
    - Claude (and similar hosts like Amazon Q or Copilot) typically manages user authentication and authorization at the platform layer.
    - When an MCP server/client operates inside this environment, it relies on the host to enforce user/session security. The server expects requests only from trusted, authenticated sessions maintained by Claude.
    - As a result, many MCP integrations do not duplicate authentication (checking API keys, user tokens, etc.) in the MCP interface—they trust the host’s session/context.
- **Semgrep Rule Implications:**
    - The standard rule for "Missing Authentication or Authorization Controls" would trigger a finding if no explicit auth logic is present.
    - In MCP repos designed purely as plugins/extensions for Claude-like hosts, this is not always a true risk—security is “inherited” by design.
    - Exact context should be documented in config files or manifest, specifying reliance on external (host-driven) security.
- **Exceptions \& Risks:**
    - If the MCP server is **ever exposed outside the controlled host environment** (e.g., as a public API endpoint, CLI, or in custom deployments), then inherited auth is no longer sufficient. In these cases, explicit authentication and authorization controls should be implemented and enforced within MCP.
    - If there is any uncertainty about whether connections are only host-internal, an explicit control or check is recommended for safety.


### Summary Table

| MCP Deployed Where? | Auth Needs in MCP? | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Only inside Claude host | Usually No | Host wraps/authenticates all requests |
| Exposed as standalone API | Yes | Must implement its own auth/RBAC protections |
| Embedded but CLI option | Yes | CLI exposure may bypass Claude, so checks needed |

### Best Practice

- Document in the repo’s manifest or README that the server “relies on host authentication”—so future audits and tools like Semgrep can safely suppress the missing-auth finding when appropriate.
- If unsure about all possible deployment modes, it is safer to enforce at least one layer of authentication at the MCP level.

# Detecting MCP Security Issues and Usage with Semgrep

## MCP Security Issues: What to Detect

According to the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) documentation and leading security research, the most critical MCP-specific security issues include:

- **Prompt Injection**: Attackers can craft prompts that cause LLM agents to invoke MCP tools in unintended, potentially dangerous ways. Tool descriptions themselves can also be poisoned to manipulate behavior[^18_1][^18_2].
- **Credentials Exposure**: MCP servers may store and use sensitive API keys or credentials for other systems, creating risk of leak or misuse[^18_1][^18_2].
- **Malicious or Compromised MCP Servers**: Integrations may be trojaned or impersonate legitimate tools, risking supply chain attacks and the exfiltration or modification of sensitive data[^18_1][^18_3].
- **Tool/Resource Over-permissioning**: MCP servers may request excessive permission scopes[^18_1].
- **Lack of Input/Output Validation**: Insufficient validation for agent-tool communication expands the attack surface[^18_2].
- **Missing Authentication \& Authorization**: Absent or weak access controls (sometimes due to reliance on an AI host for security) can expose MCP servers if they are deployed externally[^18_4].
- **Lack of Visibility \& Monitoring**: Undetected actions and access patterns obscure potential exploitation[^18_3].
- **Configuration Weaknesses**: Unvetted MCP manifests or unvalidated configuration files may allow insecure parameters or environments[^18_5][^18_6].
- **Session Management Issues**: Important for MCP servers that manage user state across sessions.


## Detecting How an MCP is Being Used

To tell how an MCP is being used (its **role** and integration context), static analysis tools like Semgrep must either:

1. **Scan for and Parse Key Configuration Files**
    - MCP repositories almost always include config files like:
        - `mcp.json` (often contains explicit `"role"` and `"integration_target"`)
        - `tool-manifest.json` or `manifest.json` (lists capabilities, integration endpoints, and commands)
        - `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.amazonq/mcp.json` (editor- or cloud-specific MCP role/config)
        - `README.md` (human-readable summary and usage context)
        - Server setup files (showing port, environment variables, permissions)
    - These files reveal the declared role (host, client, server), integration target (“snowflake,” “figma,” etc.), required permissions, and operational endpoints[^18_5][^18_6].
2. **Inspect Code for Patterns Related to Usage Context**
    - Semgrep rules can be written to:
        - Detect service startup modes: distinguish between local-only use (inherited from host, e.g., Claude) and externally-reachable server APIs.
        - Identify tool/resource definitions (“tools”, “capabilities”, sensitive operations).
        - Look for authentication bypasses (or total reliance on host-managed context).
        - Parse environment-specific configuration or command registrations.
    - Examples:
        - Checking if the MCP only listens on `localhost` (host integration) vs. `0.0.0.0` (exposed over a network).
        - Locating handler patterns (`app.route`, Express endpoints, etc.) and checking context in which they are called.
3. **Review Metadata, Comments, and Documentation**
    - Human descriptions in `README.md` or inline comments can clarify “this server is only for use in Claude Desktop” or “integration: Snowflake, requires API key.”

## Practical Steps to Use Semgrep for Both Security and Usage Detection

1. **Write and Run Security Rules**
    - Apply rules for prompt injection risk, credential exposure, missing authentication, insecure config, etc. Many of these rules can be auto-generated based on the MCP security best practices and are available in curated rule sets[^18_2][^18_7].
2. **Write Usage/Environment Rules**
    - Create custom Semgrep rules to:
        - Search for specific config keys (`"role":`, `"integration_target":`) in `mcp.json` or manifests.
        - Parse files for clues about host vs. external API use, integration domains, or allowed commands.
3. **Automate File Discovery**
    - Use Semgrep’s multi-language and regex support to scan for config file presence and extract key fields.
    - Example: A rule detecting `"role": "server"` in `mcp.json` and also parsing `"integration_target": "snowflake"` will clearly indicate that this package is a server-facing integration to a Snowflake data warehouse.
4. **Human-in-the-Loop Review**
    - In ambiguous cases (e.g., mixed usage, incomplete configs), combine Semgrep findings with manual review of project structure, comments, and deployment docs.

## Example Semgrep Rule Patterns for Role and Security Detection

- Detecting MCP role in config:

```yaml
- id: mcp-detect-server-role
  pattern: '"role": "server"'
  paths:
    include: ["mcp.json", "*.manifest.json", "tool-manifest.json"]
  severity: info
```

- Detecting target integration:

```yaml
- id: mcp-detect-integration-snowflake
  pattern: '"integration_target": "snowflake"'
  paths:
    include: ["mcp.json", "*.manifest.json"]
  severity: info
```


## Table: Key MCP Role/Usage Signals for Semgrep

| File/Pattern | Usage Insight Provided |
| :-- | :-- |
| `mcp.json["role"] == "server"` | Exposes tools directly |
| `mcp.json["integration_target"]` | Shows which system is targeted |
| Manifest with tool/capabilities | Indicates available operations |
| Config references to Claude, Q, UI | Suggests host-only (internal) use |
| Network/handler patterns | Presence/absence of external exposure |
| Absence of auth logic | May rely on inherited host security |

## Conclusion

- **Detecting security issues**: Use Semgrep rules tailored to MCP best practices, focusing on known risks like prompt injection, credential leakage, supply chain risks, and permission scoping.
- **Determining how MCP is used**: Scan configuration and manifest files for declared roles and integration targets. Augment with rules that identify usage context in both code and metadata.
- **Key output**: Automated tools can provide clear signals on whether an MCP repo is a host plugin, a direct server, its integration domain (e.g., Snowflake vs. Figma), and the nature of security controls or gaps present.

## Is Prompt Injection a Runtime Issue?

### What Is Prompt Injection?

Prompt injection refers to a scenario where attackers manipulate the input (prompt) sent to a large language model (LLM) or an AI agent, causing it to execute unintended or malicious actions—such as invoking tools, disclosing sensitive data, or altering behavior. In the context of Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar architectures, this typically means an attacker crafts inputs (often natural language or specially formatted content) that transition from “safe” user prompts to “dangerous” instructions for the LLM or its associated tool suite.

### Runtime vs. Static Risk

- **Prompt Injection Is Primarily a Runtime Issue**
Prompt injection occurs when external, possibly untrusted, user input is processed live by the LLM or system. The attack cannot be fully realized until runtime, as it exploits the dynamic processing and interpretation of prompts and tool descriptions.
Static analysis tools (like Semgrep) can help reduce exposure by:
    - Flagging code or configuration that passes untrusted data to tool descriptions, LLM context, or agent workflows without sanitization.
    - Identifying use of string concatenation, template expansion, or other risky text injection surfaces in tool/external calls.
    - Surfacing code/design patterns that make prompt injection easier to trigger (e.g., excessive tool permissions, lack of validation).
- **Root Cause Is in Code and Static Assets**
While the exploit happens at runtime, the "surface area"—how prompts, templates, and tool descriptions are constructed or exposed—often originates in how static code or manifests are written. Certain tool descriptions or command mappings can pre-dispose an agent to act in insecure ways when manipulated at runtime.


### Defense Implications

- **Testing and Safeguards Are Needed at Both Levels:**
    - *Static analysis* can flag obvious prompting anti-patterns, suspicious interpolation, or insufficient input controls.
    - *Runtime monitoring and input validation* are essential to detect, block, or respond to prompt injection as it occurs.
- **Best Practice:**
Combine static code/manifest review (prevention of bad surfaces) and runtime controls (validation, output filtering, monitoring) for strong defense-in-depth.


### Summary Table

| Attack Type | Detected at | Requires Runtime for Exploit? | Static Prevention Possible? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Prompt Injection | Static/code \& runtime | Yes | Partially (reduce attack surface) |

**In conclusion:**
Prompt injection is fundamentally a runtime issue—but both static and runtime defenses are needed. Static reviews (e.g., with Semgrep) can reduce the likelihood and impact, but some risks only manifest with real input and must be caught dynamically through validation, user intent confirmation, and monitoring.

# Where Are the Prompt Logs When Claude Is Using an MCP?

When Anthropic's Claude interacts with an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server or tool, prompt logs and related activity are handled in several locations depending on deployment and configuration.

## Default Log Locations

### Claude Desktop and Claude Code

- **macOS**
    - Prompt and session logs, including MCP plugin/tool usage, are typically stored as `.jsonl` files within:
        - `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
        - `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log` (includes MCP-specific activity)
        - Session transcripts: `~/.claude/projects/` (organized by project, with JSONL files per session)[^20_1][^20_2][^20_3][^20_4].
- **Windows**
    - The equivalent folder is:
        - `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Claude\Logs\`
        - Individual MCP logs: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Claude\Logs\mcp.log` and `mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log`
        - Session transcripts may also be found under `.claude\projects\` in your user directory[^20_4].


### Prompt Logging Behavior

- By default, prompt logs record the sequence of inputs and tool invocations. If you want to analyze all your session prompts, you can filter and convert the `*.jsonl` transcript files to a readable format using utilities like [claude-code-log][^20_5].
- For real-time monitoring of MCP logs on macOS:
    - Use `tail -F ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
- On Windows:
    - `Get-Content "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Claude\Logs\mcp.log" -Wait -Tail 20`
    - Or use WSL for the Unix-style `tail -f`[^20_4].


## OpenTelemetry (OTel) and Custom Prompt Logging

- **Claude Code** supports OpenTelemetry for prompt logging and metrics, but user prompt content is **not logged by default** for privacy reasons.
    - To record user prompt text (not just metadata), set the environment variable:

```
OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1
```

    - OTel logs (including events such as tool invocations and API requests) can then be exported to your configured backend or stored in files, depending on setup[^20_6][^20_7].
    - See your orchestration environment (e.g., Docker, cloud run) for specifics on how logs are aggregated.


## Prompt Logs for MCP Plug-in Servers

- Some MCP server implementations log all prompts handled by the server, regardless of what is logged by Claude. For example:
    - A lightweight MCP server may locally log prompts to `./data/prompts.db` (or specified path via environment variable), for audit and journaling[^20_8].


## Additional Sources

- **Manual Retrieval:** If you need to review all conversation prompts, transcripts, or tool usage, inspect the files in:
    - `~/.claude/projects/` (macOS/Linux)
    - `.claude\projects\` (Windows)
- **Conversion Tools:** Use tools like `claude-code-log` to transform `.jsonl` session logs into HTML or Markdown files for easier review and searching[^20_2][^20_5].


## Summary Table: Prompt Log Locations

| Environment | Prompt Log Location | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| macOS/Linux | `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`, `~/.claude/projects/` | Real-time: tail `mcp*.log` |
| Windows | `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Claude\Logs\` | `mcp.log`, `mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log` |
| Claude Code | Local transcript JSONL files, optional OTel logs | See enabling OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS |
| MCP Server | App-defined (e.g., `./data/prompts.db`), config-dependent | May require custom extraction |

**Note:** Always respect privacy and security obligations before enabling or exporting prompt logs, as they may contain sensitive input data.

# Making MCP Security Analysis Easier for Enterprises

## 1. Automated Role \& Context Discovery

- **Standardize Key Configuration Files:** Require every MCP repo to include manifest files like `mcp.json`, `tool-manifest.json`, or `.vscode/mcp.json` summarizing the integration role (host/client/server), intended use (internal, external), and integration target (e.g., Snowflake, Figma).
- **Develop Auto-Detection Scripts:** Provide ready-to-use scripts that scan for these manifests, extract integration role and context, and auto-suppress or escalate findings based on usage scenario.
- **Centralized Indexing:** Build or join a registry that indexes MCP integrations by type, usage, and sensitivity tier for cross-team visibility.


## 2. Enterprise-Ready Semgrep Integration

- **Curated MCP Rule Bundles:** Offer certified, maintained MCP Semgrep rule sets with tiered severity, constant updates, and enterprise support.
- **Role-Aware Scoring:** Integrate the FICO-style security score directly into CI systems, adjusting for integration role (e.g., require stricter standards for critical data connectors).
- **False-Positive Suppression:** Allow automatic suppression of authentication findings for integrations proven to operate only via trusted hosts like Claude, based on manifest analysis or enterprise allowlists.


## 3. Unified Security Dashboards

- **Central Portal:** Aggregate all scan results, scoring, and remediation recommendations in a web dashboard accessible by security, dev, and compliance teams.
- **Contextual Findings:** Present findings by repo, integration role, and criticality, making it easy to prioritize and schedule fixes.


## 4. Access and Audit Controls

- **Prompt Log Archival:** Standardize prompt and tool invocation logging, storage, and querying across environments for audit and incident response compliance.
- **Role-Based Access to Results:** Restrict access to sensitive logs and findings by team/role, supporting compliance and data minimization policies.


## 5. Enterprise Policy Templates

- **Predefined Score Thresholds:** Ship policy bundles that map score thresholds to required remediation actions based on role (e.g., 820+ for finance/data, 740+ for collaboration tools).
- **Configurable Exceptions:** Allow security teams to document and approve deliberate deviations (with expiration dates and business justifications) for certain findings, streamlining compliance reviews.


## 6. Education, Support \& Enablement

- **Best Practice Guides:** Provide concise, illustrated documentation for both developers and security teams explaining MCP risks, review process, and scoring methodology.
- **Training \& Office Hours:** Offer regular webinars, hands-on demos, and Q\&A with experts to accelerate onboarding and empower internal champions.
- **Support Channels:** Enterprise support ticketing and escalation procedures ensure critical issues are resolved quickly.


## 7. Advanced Automation \& Enrichment

- **API Integration:** Expose APIs to trigger scans, retrieve findings, adjust scoring, and connect results to ticketing or risk platforms (like Jira, ServiceNow).
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Support scheduled background scans and real-time alerting for new findings, repository changes, or policy violations.
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Encourage the development of MCP-aware plugins for IDEs, CI/CD, and SIEM platforms.

By combining configuration standardization, automation, context-aware rules, role-based scoring, and robust reporting, enterprises can dramatically simplify MCP security management and integrate it with their broader application security and compliance programs.

# Forcing All MCP Integrations in an Enterprise to Log Prompts

Ensuring that every Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration across an enterprise logs all prompts is a critical step for auditability, compliance, forensic analysis, and risk management. Achieving this across diverse environments requires a combination of technical controls, policy enforcement, and platform integration.

## 1. Enforce Configuration Standards

- **Mandate Standardized Logging**: Require all MCP components (servers, plugins, clients) to support prompt logging in a machine-readable format (e.g., JSONL files, OpenTelemetry logs).
- **Uniform Logging Field Requirements**: Define log schema including timestamp, session/user ID, prompt text, tool invocation, and response/output.
- **Centralized Config Management**: Use infrastructure tools (e.g., IaC, config management systems like Ansible, Puppet, or enterprise secrets managers) to push and enforce logging config flags across all deployments.


## 2. Make Logging Non-Optional at Deployment

- **Enforced Build/Release Policies**: Require MCP repos to automatically enable logging at startup, with logs directed to a known path or monitoring endpoint.
- **Default to Logging On**: Disable the ability to turn off prompt logging except through privileged enterprise override.
- **Integrate with Existing Platforms**: When MCP is deployed via orchestrators (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), bake the logging config/environment variable into the container or pod spec.


## 3. Runtime Environment Controls

- **Set Platform-Wide Environment Variables**:
    - For MCP servers or clients supporting OpenTelemetry or similar logging, set variables such as:

```
OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1
MCP_LOG_PROMPTS=1
LOG_LEVEL=prompt
```

in deployment, CI/CD, or provisioning scripts.
- **Monitor for Compliance**: Continuously scan running MCP deployments to verify prompt logging is active; automatically alert or terminate instances not in compliance.


## 4. Policy \& Governance

- **Enterprise Policy Requirement**: Formalize a policy stating all MCP deployments must log prompts, with legal and contractual backing for enforcement.
- **Enforce via Code Review and CI/CD**:
    - Add checks in static analysis and CI pipelines to reject builds or deployments lacking prompt logging code or config.
- **Document Logging Locations**: Maintain an internal index of where all prompt logs are stored, and rotate archives according to compliance needs.


## 5. Centralize, Aggregate, and Secure Prompt Logs

- **Forward Logs to a SIEM or Central Store**: Use existing enterprise log aggregation systems (Splunk, Elastic, S3, etc.) for all prompt logs from MCP deployments.
- **Enforce Access Controls**: Limit log access to only authorized personnel, in line with enterprise privacy and regulatory guidance.


## 6. Audit \& Verification

- **Automated Audits**: Schedule regular audits to check MCP components for prompt logging compliance (e.g., scan for presence of logs or correct environment variables).
- **Incident Response Readiness**: Ensure that logs are retained, searchable, and immutable in line with enterprise policy for security investigations.


## 7. Platform-Specific Tips

| Platform | How to Enforce Prompt Logging |
| :-- | :-- |
| Claude/Amazon Q | Enable `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1`; manage via org console or script. |
| Kubernetes | Hard-code logging env variables in pod deployment YAML. |
| Docker/Compose | Use `env_file` or command-line flags to force logging. |
| VS Code MCP | Require `.vscode/mcp.json` includes `"log_prompts": true`. |

## 8. Communication and Training

- **Developer Documentation**: Clearly document mandatory prompt logging for MCP integrations, with code examples.
- **Training**: Educate developers and admins on enabling and verifying prompt logging at every stage.


## 9. Enforcement Example

Sample enforcement in a CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Check for prompt logging env
    run: |
      grep -q "OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS=1" Dockerfile || exit 1
```


## 10. Summary Table

| Action | Tool/Mechanism | Responsible Team |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Enforce log config | IaC, env vars, policy | SRE/DevOps |
| Monitor/alert non-compliance | Monitoring/alerting stack | Security/Ops |
| Audit log presence | Automated scripts/audits | Compliance/Security |
| Centralize logs | SIEM, log aggregation | IT/Security |

**In summary:**
Enterprise-wide prompt logging for MCP is accomplished by standardizing configuration, mandating non-optional logging in every deployment, centralizing log storage, continuously auditing for compliance, and building enforcement into both technical and organizational workflows.

# Do the Semgrep Rules Make Sense for MCP?

## Alignment with MCP Security Needs

The proposed Semgrep rules for MCP codebases directly address the main classes of security risks and operational requirements highlighted by the official Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification. Core MCP-specific issues—such as missing authentication, insecure transport, weak session handling, potential prompt injection surfaces, manifest/configuration errors, and overexposed tool permissions—are all covered through the ruleset.

### Key Considerations

- **Role Awareness:**
The rules are structured to detect security vulnerabilities regardless of whether the repo acts as a server, client, or host. This is important, as the operational context (internal plugin vs. exposed API) changes risk profile. The rules provide signals that let teams adapt findings according to deployment scenario.
- **Inherited Security Context:**
For MCPs embedded within hosts like Claude, it’s appropriate to allow overrides or suppress some authentication warnings if the repo is clearly documented as “host-internal only.” However, unsafe or accidental exposure (e.g., standalone deployment) is still detected.
- **Protocol Controls:**
Rules pertaining to origin validation, session management, supply chain pinning, and prompt-logging are all consistent with the MCP spec’s security and audit expectations.
- **Scoring and Policy Integration:**
Severities and score adjustments are mapped to business risk and regulatory impact, supporting automated enforcement, enterprise audit, and triage prioritization aligned with real MCP usage.


## When the Rules Are Most Effective

The rules make the most sense in these scenarios:

- MCP integrations that are likely to be exposed as networked services (servers, APIs).
- MCP connectors that may be repurposed beyond original host-controlled environments.
- Enterprises seeking standardized, repeatable, and evidence-driven MCP security reviews.


## Situations Requiring Exceptions or Additional Guidance

- **Host-Only Plugins:**
If the MCP is strictly for use inside a trusted LLM host where all security is enforced externally, don’t treat missing in-code authentication as a critical finding—but require this be documented in the repo’s manifest or README.
- **Prompt Injection Risk:**
Semgrep and static analysis can only partially mitigate prompt injection. These rules can flag poor surface hygiene (e.g., passing unsanitized input to tool descriptions), but runtime and monitoring controls are also needed.


## Enterprise Considerations

Enterprises can further benefit by:

- Standardizing manifest/config patterns so role and security context are always machine-readable.
- Integrating Semgrep scans and FICO-style scoring directly into CI/CD pipelines for continuous monitoring and compliance tracking.
- Automatically adjusting rule enforcement based on integration criticality and documented deployment roles.


## Conclusion

**Yes, these Semgrep rules make sense for MCP.** They are both technically and operationally relevant, map directly to the risks called out in the MCP specification, and are flexible enough for real-world enterprise adoption. The key is to supplement them with role/context identification and combine static results with runtime best practices for truly robust security coverage.

---

## Authentication Not Relevant: What This Means for MCP Security Rules

### Context

If authentication is “not relevant” for your MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, it typically means:

- The MCP component is only ever invoked in a trusted environment (for example, strictly as an internal plugin to a host system like Claude, Amazon Q, or Copilot).
- The host application or platform is responsible for all authentication and authorization checks, and does not expose the MCP server directly to external, unauthenticated networks.
- Security enforcement (user session, permissions, organization context) is inherited fully from the host platform, and not intended to be replicated at the MCP level.


### How to Handle Semgrep Authentication Rules in This Case

- **Document Reliance on Host Authentication:**
Clearly specify in your MCP repository’s configuration and README that authentication is managed and enforced by the host, and that the MCP interface is not meant for standalone deployment.
- **Suppress Irrelevant Findings:**
If static analysis (e.g., Semgrep) flags missing authentication in your MCP code, note the context and mark the finding as a false positive or suppress it in CI/CD pipelines for confirmed host-only integrations.
- **Conditional Enforcement:**
You may configure your ruleset or scoring logic to ignore or downgrade authentication-related findings only if the MCP manifest or deployment docs explicitly confirm host-only usage.
- **Key Principle:**
The goal is to ensure that MCP authentication is enforced at the correct layer:
    - If the MCP is ever deployed outside the trusted host, authentication controls become critical and must be implemented in the codebase.
    - For strictly internal, host-controlled deployments, code-level authentication is redundant and may be omitted—provided this is clear in documentation.


### Summary Table: When Authentication Is (and Isn’t) Relevant

| MCP Deployment Context | Auth in MCP Code? | Action |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Trusted host-only (Claude, Q) | Not relevant | Document reliance on host, suppress static findings |
| Standalone/exposed server | Yes, required | Implement and enforce authentication in MCP codebase |
| Ambiguous/mixed use | Yes, recommended | Default to safe, implement at least basic control |

### Best Practice

- Always make the intended security posture and deployment context explicit in your project documentation and config files.
- For enterprise teams, standardize manifest fields indicating reliance on host authentication. This enables automated rule suppression and streamlines security audits.
- Regularly review deployment practices to ensure the MCP component cannot be accidentally exposed outside its trusted environment.

**In summary:** If authentication is not relevant due to inherited security from the host environment, make this explicit in your repo, mark static findings as not applicable, and ensure all deployments are truly host-contained. For any other exposure scenario, MCP-level authentication is still necessary.

# How to Identify MCP Role and Context from Repository Code

Understanding the role and usage scenario of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration directly from its repository code is crucial for applying correct security controls and audit standards. Here is how you can reliably determine the role and integration context by inspecting the repo itself.

## 1. Key Configuration and Manifest Files

Most MCP repos include structured config files specifying their purpose and capabilities. By examining these files, you can quickly identify:

- **Role** (e.g., server, client, host/plugin)
- **Integration target** (the external service, app, or domain)
- **Supported actions/capabilities**

**Look for the following files and fields:**


| File Name / Path | Information Revealed | Typical Fields/Content |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `mcp.json` | Explicitly declares MCP role and target | `role`, `integration_target`, `capabilities` |
| `tool-manifest.json`, `manifest.json` | Describes tools, commands, and integration | Tool names, permissions, service descriptor |
| `.vscode/mcp.json` | Editor extensions—summarizes integration config | `servers`, `role`, `command`, `args` |
| `README.md` | Describes intended use and environment | Usage instructions, deployment notes, limitations |
| `.amazonq/mcp.json`, other IDE configs | Package/runtime config | Mirrors core manifest, can indicate host/client/server |

### Example: Partial `mcp.json`

```json
{
  "role": "server",
  "integration_target": "snowflake",
  "capabilities": ["runQuery", "listTables"]
}
```

This specifies an MCP server role for Snowflake.

## 2. Code and Handler Patterns

You can infer usage and deployment by scanning for certain code constructs:

- **Server/handler declarations:** Functions handling HTTP, SSE, or stdio communication (e.g., `app.route(...)`, `http.ListenAndServe(...)`) indicate a server role.
- **Tool/capability registration:** How tools, commands, or resources are exposed to the host.
- **Authentication checks:** Lack thereof often suggests host-only usage, while explicit bearer/API key checks suggest exposure to external clients.


## 3. Comments, Metadata, and Documentation

Many repos include summaries or metadata describing integration context:

- `README.md` files often state whether the MCP is for internal (host/plugin) or external (API/server) use.
- Code comments may specify intended deployment scenarios and whether standalone operation is supported.


## 4. Environment Variables and Startup Modes

Examine initialization scripts or setup files for clues:

- **Bindings:** If code binds only to `localhost`, it is likely intended for host/plugin integration.
- **Credentials/config:** Presence of deployment-specific secrets or network interface configuration suggests network-exposed operation.
- **Command and argument setups:** Arguments passed to start the MCP may include role/type info[^25_1][^25_2][^25_3].


## 5. Security, Capability, and Policy Declarations

- Tool definitions in manifest files frequently list available actions, their security scopes, and permission requirements.
- Check for `permissions`, `scopes`, or similar fields, indicating restricted vs. open access.


## 6. VS Code, Amazon Q, and Dev Container Integrations

Many developer-facing MCP integrations use editor or cloud platform config files:

- VS Code’s `.vscode/mcp.json` and corresponding sections in `devcontainer.json` often mirror manifest content, reaffirming the integration’s role and network exposure[^25_2][^25_4].


## Table: Common Indicators and Their Meaning

| Indicator Found | Likely Role or Usage |
| :-- | :-- |
| `role: "server"` in config | MCP Server (exposes tools as services) |
| `integration_target: "snowflake"` | Connects to Snowflake/data warehouse |
| Presence of only host/internal endpoints | Intended for host/plugin usage (e.g., Claude, Q) |
| Explicit auth logic (API keys, tokens) | Meant for external/public access |
| Tool/capability manifest | Server exposes actions to host/agent |

## Summary

You can determine how an MCP is being used by:

- Inspecting manifest/configuration files for explicit role and target fields.
- Reviewing core code files for handler patterns, authentication logic, and tool descriptors.
- Reading documentation and metadata for deployment and security assumptions.

Every well-formed MCP repo should clearly declare its integration role and context in structured files, allowing automated tools and reviewers to reliably infer usage and compliance requirements[^25_5][^25_3][^25_2][^25_4][^25_6].

# Determining the MCP Deployment Context

Understanding which **Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment context** applies to a given MCP integration is essential for enforcing appropriate security, scoring, and operational policies. The deployment context determines whether critical controls—like authentication—must be present, or whether the component is protected by the environment it operates within.

## Key Deployment Contexts for MCP

- **Host-Only / Plugin (Internal)**: Used exclusively within a trusted environment or host (e.g., Claude, Amazon Q, Copilot). Security, authentication, and context are managed by the host.
- **Standalone / Public Server:** Deployed as a service that accepts incoming requests from external clients or networks. Responsible for managing its own authentication, permissions, and exposure controls.
- **Hybrid / Ambiguous:** Designed to support both internal (plugin) mode and explicit public API/server mode, depending on configuration or deployment.


## How to Identify the MCP Deployment Context

### 1. Check Configuration and Manifest Files

- **Look for Role Fields:**
Files like `mcp.json`, `tool-manifest.json`, or `manifest.json` often list fields such as `role`, `integration_target`, or `mode`:
    - `"role": "server"` (standalone/public API)
    - `"role": "plugin"` or `"plugin": true` (host-only, internal)
- **Integration Target:**
An entry like `"integration_target": "claude"` or similar signals host-only usage; `"snowflake"`, `"github"`, etc., suggest connecting with an external API.


### 2. Inspect Entry Points and Bindings

- **Network Bindings:**
Code binding only to `localhost` implies internal/host use. Binding to `0.0.0.0` or external interfaces suggests public or semi-public deployment.
- **Authentication Presence:**
Absence of authentication logic often means the MCP is a plugin/host-only integration (provided this is documented). Presence of explicit checks (API tokens, OAuth, etc.) suggests a public or hybrid role.


### 3. Review Documentation and Metadata

- **README.md and Comments:**
Documentation may state intended context, such as “For use only with Claude Desktop,” “Public server for data warehouse query,” or clarify exposure assumptions.


### 4. Analyze Tool/Resource Registration

- **Declared Capabilities:**
Tools that perform sensitive actions, reference production data, or appear scoped for broad API access typically signal standalone or hybrid deployments.


### 5. Assess Deployment and Startup Scripts

- **Environment Variables \& Arguments:**
Some deployments use flags or environment variables to toggle between modes (e.g., `MCP_MODE=standalone` vs. `MCP_MODE=plugin`).
- **Container Orchestration:**
Kubernetes/Docker files may specify network, volume mounts, and intended exposure.


## Example: Mapping MCP Role from Files

| File Field Example | Context Inferred |
| :-- | :-- |
| `"role": "plugin"` in `mcp.json` | Internal/host-only |
| `"integration_target": "claude"` | Host-embedded (Claude) |
| `"role": "server"`, `public: true` | Standalone/external |
| Only binds to `localhost` | Internal |
| Explicit `/auth` endpoints, token checks | Public/hybrid |

## Automation and Best Practices

- **Automated Scanning:**
Use scripts or static analysis tools to extract and interpret manifest/config fields, binding patterns, and authentication logic.
- **Policy Documentation:**
Every MCP repo should explicitly declare its intended context in configuration and documentation to support automated and manual audits.


## Summary

You determine which MCP deployment context fits by:

- Inspecting structured configuration/manifest files for role and target fields.
- Reviewing how the code binds to networks, handles authentication, and presents endpoints.
- Reading documentation and metadata for stated usage patterns.
- Automating this discovery with tools where possible for consistency and scale.

This systematic approach ensures each MCP component in your enterprise is understood, governed, and secured appropriately for its environment.

# Can a Semgrep Rule Identify MCP Deployment Context?

## Overview

Semgrep, as a static analysis tool, is excellent for finding patterns in source code and configuration files. When applied to Model Context Protocol (MCP) repositories, it can sometimes identify the deployment context (such as whether an MCP module is intended to be a host-only plugin, a standalone server, or a hybrid), but has important limitations.

## What Semgrep Can Directly Identify

### 1. Manifest \& Configuration-Based Context

- **Presence of Key Files**: Semgrep can match patterns within standard files (e.g., `mcp.json`, `manifest.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`) to extract explicit fields like `"role": "server"` or `"integration_target": "claude"`.
- **Role \& Target Extraction**: Custom rules can be written to alert when certain fields, values, or capabilities are declared (such as server mode, specific bindings, or integrations)[^27_1].


### 2. Code Pattern Indicators

- **Network Binding Analysis**: Rules can flag servers bound to `0.0.0.0` (network-exposed/public) or `127.0.0.1` (local/host-only), informing on likely deployment mode[^27_2], [^27_3].
- **Authentication Checks**: Patterns can reveal the explicit presence or absence of authentication logic (e.g., API key checks, OAuth middleware), which often signal intent for external vs. internal use[^27_4].
- **Handler Patterns**: Matching for specific handler routes or endpoints (such as REST APIs) can indicate whether the component expects requests beyond a host environment.


## Limitations and What Cannot Be Determined Reliably

- **Enforced Context**: Semgrep cannot, by itself, determine actual deployment context at runtime—such as whether the code will always run inside Claude or might ever be exposed externally. It only knows what the code and config declare.
- **Ambiguous Usage**: If the repo omits clear manifest fields or includes both local and public startup modes, rules may struggle to determine intent.
- **Documentation Reliance**: Subtle cues in README files or comments might require rules using broad text-matching, which can be brittle and imprecise.


## Example Semgrep Rule Approaches

| What You Want to Know | Example Pattern Detected | Works Reliably? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Declared role in manifest | `"role": "server"` | Yes, if field present |
| Internal-only endpoint | bind to `127.0.0.1` only | Usually |
| Public exposure | bind to `0.0.0.0` | Yes, in most code |
| Host integration (Claude, Q, etc.) | `"integration_target": "claude"` | Yes, if field present |
| Absence of authentication | lack of auth patterns | Sometimes, context-dependent |

## Summary

- **Yes:** Semgrep rules can often identify MCP deployment context by matching explicit fields in config and certain code patterns, especially when the repository follows best practice for documentation and manifests.
- **No:** Semgrep cannot always determine true operational or runtime context and may need human review or additional enforcement (such as standardized manifest fields) for unambiguous context identification.

For best results, MCP repos should standardize manifest/config fields describing role and integration context to enable precise static analysis and context-aware rule enforcement[^27_1][^27_2][^27_3].

# Tools and Approaches to Use Alongside Semgrep for MCP Security and Context Analysis

To gain a comprehensive security and compliance view for MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations—beyond what Semgrep provides for static analysis—you should layer in complementary tools and data sources. This ensures not only code issues, but also configuration, runtime, and usage context are covered.

## 1. Static Analysis Tools (Python + General)

- **Bandit:** Specializes in Python security vulnerabilities, complementing Semgrep with checks for unsafe imports, dynamic execution, and exposure of secrets[^28_1][^28_2].
- **Pylint/Flake8/Pyflakes:** Excellent for linting, code quality, dead code, and error detection—providing additional warning classes and quality metrics[^28_1][^28_3][^28_2].
- **Mypy/Pyright:** Enforces static type safety, catching bugs and misused variables at code review time[^28_1][^28_3][^28_2].
- **Prospector:** Bundles several analysis tools (Pylint, pycodestyle, Bandit, Mypy, and more) for aggregated static feedback[^28_1].
- **Secret Scanners:** Tools like Dodgy or Trivy can scan for hardcoded secrets, AWS keys, or unsafe environment variable handling[^28_1][^28_4].


## 2. MCP-Specific and Agentic Security Tools

- **MCP-Scan (Invariant Labs):** Statically and dynamically analyzes MCP config and runtime for issues like prompt injections, tool poisoning, cross-origin escalation, tool rug pulls, and more. Includes proxy-based real-time monitoring, tool pinning, and integrity checks[^28_5][^28_6][^28_7].
    - Scans config files, tool manifests, and actively monitors MCP network traffic for suspicious activity.
    - Compatible with popular hosts like Claude, Cursor, and others.
- **mcpscan.ai:** An MCP-focused security scanner that checks common vulnerabilities in servers, agent interactions, and tool definitions[^28_7].
- **Custom Rules in Other Linters:** Extend Pylint/Bandit with project-specific plugins to capture MCP-specific anti-patterns not handled by default rules[^28_1].


## 3. Dependency, Supply Chain, and Secret Auditing

- **Trivy:** Scans code and dependencies for known CVEs, as well as misconfigurations[^28_1].
- **Pip-audit:** Detects Python dependency vulnerabilities and highlights unpinned requirements.
- **Codiga, Codacy:** Cloud platforms that aggregate output from multiple static analysis and vulnerability tools (including Semgrep), making it easier to triage and track issues across repos[^28_1][^28_4][^28_8].


## 4. Runtime and System Monitoring

- **Application \& Prompt Logging:** Ensure centralized logging of all MCP sessions, prompt invocations, and tool usage. Forward logs to a SIEM (Splunk, Elastic, etc.) for behavioral analysis and threat detection[^28_9][^28_10][^28_11].
- **Network \& Access Telemetry:** Leverage endpoint, identity, and cloud logs (Okta, AWS IAM, cloud control plane) to correlate AI agent activity with actual user/resource access in MCP workflows[^28_9][^28_11].
- **Real-Time MCP Proxies:** Use tools (like `mcp-scan proxy`) that actively watch and, if necessary, block suspicious MCP runtime interactions or unauthorized tool calls[^28_5][^28_6].


## 5. Context \& Manifest Analysis

- **Custom Scripts for Role/Context Extraction:** Scripts or light parsers that read manifest/config files (`mcp.json`, `tool-manifest.json`, etc.) to extract MCP role, integration target, permissions, and exposure—helping to automate context-driven policy enforcement.
- **Continuous Integration (CI/CD) Enforcement:** Integrate all tools above in CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), gating deployments on clean static, dynamic, and dependency scans.


## Summary Table: Recommended Toolset

| Category | Tools/Platforms | Role |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Static Analysis | Semgrep, Bandit, Pylint, Flake8 | Code quality \& security patterns |
| MCP Security | MCP-Scan, mcpscan.ai | MCP-specific attack/threat checks |
| Dependency Audit | Trivy, pip-audit, Codiga | CVE and supply chain integrity |
| Runtime Monitoring | App/prompt logs, SIEM, OTel | Usage, monitoring, incident audit |
| Manifest Extraction | Custom scripts, CI/CD checks | Automate role and config analysis |

## Best Practice

Robust MCP analysis is multi-layered:

- Use Semgrep plus 2–3 other static and dependency tools for broad coverage.
- Leverage MCP-specific scanners for agentic and protocol attacks.
- Centralize prompt/user logs for real-time and forensic security.
- Automate role/context inference to minimize false positives and match policy to risk.

This integrated approach provides continuous, actionable insights for securing MCP environments at enterprise scale[^28_1][^28_5][^28_9].

# Identifying MCP Deployment Context: Trusted Host, Standalone, or Mixed Use

To determine whether a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration is deployed as host-only (trusted environment), standalone (publicly accessible), or mixed use, follow this process:

## 1. Inspect Key Configuration Files

Review the presence and contents of core manifest and config files:

- **`mcp.json`, `manifest.json`, `tool-manifest.json`:**
    - Look for fields like `"role"`, `"integration_target"`, or `"mode"`.
        - `"role": "plugin"` or `"integration_target": "claude"` typically signals trusted host-only use.
        - `"role": "server"` may indicate a standalone or mixed deployment, especially if paired with `"public": true` or similar keys.
- **IDE and Editor Configuration:**
    - Files such as `.vscode/mcp.json` can clarify whether the integration expects to run inside VS Code, Claude Desktop, or other host platforms.


## 2. Analyze Network Bindings in Code

Check startup scripts or source code for how network communication is handled:

- **Trusted Host-Only:** MCP server binds only to `127.0.0.1` or uses standard input/output (STDIO) for local integrations—only accessible to the local host application.
- **Standalone:** MCP server binds to `0.0.0.0` or an external-facing IP, exposing endpoints over HTTP/SSE for remote clients[^29_1][^29_2].
- **Mixed Use:** The code may accept both connection types, often configurable via environment variables, flags, or config fields.


## 3. Examine Authentication and Authorization Logic

- **Trusted Host-Only:** No explicit authentication in MCP code, relying on the host to enforce security.
- **Standalone or Mixed Use:** Presence of API keys, OAuth middleware, or token checks in handler code suggests the server anticipates direct access from external clients and requires self-managed security[^29_3][^29_4].


## 4. Review Documentation and Metadata

- **Review `README.md` and code comments:** These often state intended usage, such as “For use only inside Claude Desktop” (trusted host), or “Public API integration for enterprise data source” (standalone/mixed).


## 5. Environmental and Deployment Clues

- **Containerization and Orchestration:** Deployment descriptors (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes YAML) may reveal exposed ports and default bindings.
- **Environment Variables \& Startup Arguments:** Variables like `MCP_MODE=standalone` versus `MCP_MODE=plugin` can clarify intent.


## 6. Role Identification Table

| Signal in Code or Config | Inferred Context |
| :-- | :-- |
| `role: "plugin"` or targets Claude | Trusted host-only |
| `role: "server"`, public:true | Standalone or mixed use |
| Binds to `127.0.0.1`, uses STDIO | Trusted host-only |
| Binds to `0.0.0.0` or public IP | Standalone/mixed |
| No auth checks, doc says “host only” | Trusted host-only |
| Explicit API keys/token checks | Standalone/mixed |

## 7. Best Practices

- Standardize project manifests to always include explicit `"role"` and `"integration_target"` fields.
- Automate parsing and scanning of manifest and binding patterns to classify context reliably[^29_5][^29_4][^29_1].
- Flag ambiguous repos for manual review if context cannot be confidently inferred.

**By systematically inspecting configuration, bindings, authentication logic, and documentation, you can accurately classify an MCP integration’s deployment context as trusted host-only, standalone, or mixed use.**

# giive me a python script to help identify role

Here’s a Python script that analyzes an MCP integration repository and attempts to identify its **deployment context/role** as one of the following:

- **"trusted-host-only"**: Only meant to run inside Claude or similar, not externally exposed.
- **"standalone"**: Designed to run as a server exposed to external clients.
- **"mixed-use"**: Can be configured for either host-only or public use.

| `"integration_target": "claude"` | Definitely `trusted-host-only` |
| Code binds to `127.0.0.1` | Suggests internal/host context |
| Code binds to `0.0.0.0` | Suggests it's intended as a server |
| Auth logic in code | Suggests standalone or mixed use |

## 📦 How to Use

```bash
python detect_mcp_role.py ./path/to/mcp-repo
```

**Output:**

```
🧠 Detected MCP Deployment Role: TRUSTED-HOST-ONLY
```


## 🛠️ Optional Enhancements

- Add support for `.dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`

# Coverage of the MCP Role Detection Script for JS/Node and Go Repositories

## Applicability to JS/Node and Go Projects

The provided Python script for identifying MCP deployment context was originally designed around patterns and configuration files commonly found in Python-based repositories. Here’s how it extends to JavaScript/Node (JS/Node) and Go projects:

### Configuration/Manifest File Detection

- **JS/Node Repositories**
    - Most MCP JS/Node repos do include `mcp.json`, `manifest.json`, `tool-manifest.json`, or similar JSON config files—just like Python repos.
    - The script scans these files regardless of their actual language, so as long as the repository has standard MCP manifests with `role`, `integration_target`, or related fields, detection will work.
    - It also supports VS Code plugin configs (`.vscode/mcp.json`), which are language-agnostic.
- **Go Repositories**
    - Go-based MCP repos frequently include the same structured manifest files in the root or config directory.
    - The script can parse these files and extract relevant MCP role/integration info, as long as standard field names are used.


### Source Code Pattern Matching

- The script's in-code detection looks for:
    - Network binding strings (`127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`) in any file ending with `.js`, `.ts`, or `.py` (extendable).
    - Simple indicators of authentication logic (e.g., `authenticate`, `req.headers.get("Authorization")`).
- **To maximize coverage for JS/Node and Go:**
    - You may wish to add support for files ending in `.go` to the script’s file extension filter.
    - You could expand the authentication signal patterns to include idiomatic Go/Node approaches (such as checking `r.Header.Get("Authorization")` for Go, or `req.header('authorization')` and Express middleware for Node).


### Recommended Small Tweaks

To optimize the script for JS/Node and Go repos:

- **File Extension Update:** Add `.go` to the extensions checked when scanning source files:

```python
if file.endswith((".py", ".js", ".ts", ".go")):
    ...
```

- **Regex Update for Go and Node:** Expand authentication and binding regexes to include:
    - Go: `r.Header.Get$"Authorization"$`, `http.ListenAndServe`
    - Node: `req.header('authorization')`, `app.listen(...)`


### Table: Script Readiness by Language

| Repo Type | Manifest File Support | Code Scanning Support | Extension Needed? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Python | Yes | Yes | None |
| JS/Node | Yes | Yes* | Add `.js`, `.ts` in code scan (already present) |
| Go | Yes | Partial* | Add `.go` in code scan and Go network/auth patterns |

*\* Minor tuning advised for maximum precision*

## Summary

- **Yes, the approach works for JS/Node and Go MCP repositories,** provided they include standard MCP config and manifest files.
- For best results, slightly extend the file extension and code pattern filters in the script to include idiomatic network and authentication constructs for Go and JS/Node.
- The manifest-driven detection is language-agnostic; only the in-code pattern matching requires modest adaptation.

This approach ensures consistent, cross-language MCP deployment context detection across all common enterprise languages.

---

# so same code?

Yes, you can use the **same Python script** with only minor modifications for JS/Node and Go MCP repositories. The core approach—scanning for standard MCP manifest/config files (`mcp.json`, `manifest.json`, etc.) and searching source code for network binding and authentication patterns—works across all languages.

To maximize accuracy for JS/Node and Go:

- **Add `.go` to the file extensions** being scanned in the source code analysis section, so Go files are included.
- Optionally, enhance the in-code pattern matching for authentication and network binding to better reflect Go and Node/Express idioms (e.g., matching `r.Header.Get("Authorization")` for Go, or `req.header('authorization')` for Node).

**Summary:**
Yes, the same script logic correctly identifies MCP deployment context for Python, JS/Node, and Go repos, as long as you scan relevant file extensions and look for the same manifest/config file patterns. With just a quick tweak (add `.go`), the code is ready for all three ecosystems.

# update script and give me final

Here’s your **final, updated Python script** that works for Python, JS/Node, and Go MCP repositories. It includes:

- File extension support for `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, and `.go`
- Improved authentication and network-binding pattern detection for all three languages
- Manifest/config file scanning
- Clear role determination logic

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import argparse
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Detect MCP deployment role (Python, JS/Node, Go)")
    parser.add_argument("repo", help="Path to the MCP repository")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    print(f"\n🧠 Detected MCP Deployment Role: {role.upper()}\n")
```


## ✅ Usage Example

```bash
python detect_mcp_role.py ./path/to/your/mcp-repo
```

- Works out-of-the-box on Python, JavaScript/Node, and Go MCP repos.
- No dependencies except Python 3.
- Outputs: `TRUSTED-HOST-ONLY`, `STANDALONE`, `MIXED-USE`, or `UNKNOWN`.

# Role Detection in MCP Repositories: Results and Recommendations

## Key Findings

- Out of **77** analyzed MCP repositories, **70** (91.5%) were classified as having an **"unknown" deployment role** by the current detection script.
- This high rate of indeterminate classification signals major challenges in automatic role identification and points to notable gaps in manifest standardization and implementation practices.


## Why Is Role Detection Failing?

### 1. **Inconsistent or Missing Metadata**

- Most MCP repos do not include consistent machine-readable metadata for role (e.g., server, plugin, host) or integration target in config files such as `mcp.json`, `manifest.json`, or tool manifests.
- Manifest fields like `"role"`, `"integration_target"`, or `"mode"` are often absent or use non-standardized language, making automated extraction unreliable.


### 2. **Ambiguous or Omitted Network Binding**

- Repositories rarely specify explicit network interface bindings (`127.0.0.1` for local/trusted only or `0.0.0.0` for external/public exposure) in a way detectable through static inspection, especially across Python, JS/Node, and Go projects.
- Many codebases support both modes and toggle via dynamic environment variables or CLI flags, which are hard to detect statically.


### 3. **Authentication and Context Not Explicit**

- Codebases frequently inherit authentication from a host (such as Claude or Amazon Q) without stating this in code or configs, making it unclear if explicit authentication is expected locally.
- The absence of authentication logic alone is insufficient for context inference, since it can mean either “trusted host-only” or an accidental exposure scenario[^34_1][^34_2].


### 4. **Documentation as Sole Authority**

- Many repositories rely on README files or user documentation to clarify deployment scenarios—data that is not easily or reliably parsed by code-based scanners.


## Enterprise Risks of "Unknown" Classification

- **Security Policy Enforcement Gaps:** Inability to confirm role makes it difficult to apply the correct security controls, leading to either over-permissive or overly strict enforcement.
- **Audit and Compliance Challenges:** Regulatory and operational auditing of MCP tool use becomes unreliable when system boundaries and exposure are ambiguous[^34_3][^34_1].
- **Increased Attack Surface:** “Unknown” servers are hard to monitor, and may lack necessary controls based on their actual exposure.


## How to Improve Role Detection

### Recommendations for MCP Teams

- **Mandate Manifest Fields:** Require every MCP repo to include manifest fields such as `"role"` (server, plugin, host), and `"integration_target"` (e.g., Snowflake, Claude, Figma).
- **Standardize Config Naming:** Use consistent file names and field structures in `mcp.json`, `tool-manifest.json`, and related configs.
- **Document Binding and Auth:** Where relevant, document explicit network binding and authentication/authorization strategy in both manifest and README.
- **Codebase Linter Checks:** Implement CI checks that fail on missing or ambiguous role declarations.
- **Backward Fixes:** Audit the 70 “unknown” repos to add explicit role declarations or at least README notes clarifying expected deployment scenarios.


### Technical Enhancements

- **Hybrid Static-Dynamic Detection:** Where possible, use a mix of static checks and runtime hooks to determine the actual binding and environment context during integration tests.
- **Augment Language-Specific Pattern Libraries:** Expand static rules to cover idiomatic patterns in all supported languages, including Go and Node-specific network/auth idioms[^34_4].


## At-a-Glance: Detection Statistics

| Category | Count | Percent |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Unknown | 70 | 91.5% |
| Detected | 7 | 8.5% |

## Conclusion

A 91.5% “unknown” rate for MCP role detection is a significant risk: it undermines automation, compliance, and security assurance. Immediate improvements in manifest standardization, CI enforcement, and documentation are essential for closing this visibility gap and reducing enterprise risk[^34_3][^34_4].

# Using LLMs and Enhanced Detection to Identify MCP Deployment Context from Repo Code

## Can You Go Beyond Static Scripts?

Yes—if you only have repo code and config, you can combine static detection with large language models (LLMs) and richer heuristic tools to identify whether an MCP integration is meant for trusted host-only, standalone, or mixed use.

## Approaches Beyond Simple Scripts

### 1. LLM-Assisted Repository Understanding

- **How It Works:**
Instead of relying only on manifest file fields or brittle code patterns, LLMs can “read” and interpret multiple code and config files (including comments and documentation), build a relationship graph, and reason about how the project is intended to be deployed.
- **Capabilities:**
    - Identify the likely role (`server`, `plugin`, `host`, etc.) even if fields are missing.
    - Understand network/service startup patterns, entry points, config toggles, capability manifests, and documentation in natural language.
    - Resolve ambiguous or mixed-mode cases significantly better than regex-based scripts[^35_1][^35_2].
- **Research Example:**
Tools like “RepoUnderstander” create a knowledge graph and a summary of where, how, and for what context the repository is supposed to operate, using LLM-based planning and summary generation[^35_1][^35_2].


### 2. Static Analysis Enhanced by AI

- Combine code scanning with LLM output for intention inference:
    - Use conventional static analyzers to extract symbols, bindings, manifest content, and function relationships.
    - Let an LLM review this summary (plus key raw files) to infer deployment scenarios (“binding to 0.0.0.0 and exposing REST endpoints suggests public server,” etc.)[^35_3][^35_4].
- **Benefit:**
This hybrid approach increases the likelihood of accurate classification—even when standard metadata is absent or inconsistent.


### 3. Automated Context Tools and Frameworks

- Projects like ARQAN-context-analyzer provide CI workflows to gather and summarize repo context, including network, container, and security settings[^35_5].
- Some emerging research platforms integrate both static and LLM-based context analysis for whole-repository classification[^35_1][^35_4].


## Practical Example: Using an LLM for MCP Context Detection

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Collect** all code, config, and documentation files.
2. **Pre-process**: Use static analyzers or lightweight scripts to pull key snippets, config objects, and detected entry points.
3. **Prompt an LLM** (locally or via API) with:
    - Extracted snippets and summaries
    - Key files (`mcp.json`, `manifest.json`, main server code, startup scripts, README)
    - A clear prompt: “Given these files, classify the repository as trusted-host-only, standalone, or mixed-use MCP. Support your answer.”
4. **Review**: Use the LLM’s reasoning and output as your context assessment.

You can also automate this as a pre-commit or CI check using cloud-based or local LLM deployments[^35_1][^35_6][^35_3].

## Limitations and Tips

- **LLMs can work across languages** (Python, Go, JS/Node, etc.), provided the right prompts and files are included.
- **Precision improves** the more context you extract: include not just config but also parts of the main server/client code, Docker and compose files, and README/documentation.
- **No method is perfect:** LLMs improve over static scripts for “unknowns,” but ambiguous code or unstructured projects may still require manual review[^35_1][^35_2].
- **Hybrid is best:** Use static parsing to pre-filter and summarize for the LLM to keep costs down and context focused[^35_2][^35_3][^35_4].


## Table: Comparison—Basic Script vs. LLM-Aided Detection

|  | Static Script Only | LLM-Aided/Hybrid |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Reads config | Yes | Yes |
| Reads code | Limited (regex) | Deep understanding |
| Reads comments/docs | No | Yes |
| Inference across files | Minimal | Strong |
| Resolve ambiguity | Poor | Good |
| Multi-language | Needs tuning | Yes |
| Handles legacy/varied structure | Weak | Adaptable |

## Takeaway

- **Yes, you can use LLMs—alone or as an enhancer to static analysis—to extract, summarize, and infer MCP deployment context even from challenging, inconsistent, or legacy repositories.**
- This results in significantly higher accuracy and fewer “unknown” classifications when standard fields aren’t available or reliable[^35_1][^35_2][^35_3][^35_4].

# Python Script: Extract and Analyze MCP Repo Info Using Gemini 2.5 Flash

Below is a Python script that:

- Extracts relevant MCP config/manifest files from a repo
- Builds a content summary suitable for large language models
- Sends the data to Google Gemini using your API key from the environment (`GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- Uses Gemini's most cost-efficient yet effective model: **Gemini 2.5 Flash**[^37_1][^37_2][^37_3][^37_4]
- Requests a structured summary (role, integration target, security context, etc.) in the response

You need the `google-genai` Python library:

```bash
pip install google-genai
```


## Script

```python
import os
import json
from pathlib import Path
from google import genai

def extract_relevant_files(repo_path):
    relevant_files = [
        "mcp.json", "manifest.json", "tool-manifest.json", "mcp-config.json",
        ".vscode/mcp.json", ".amazonq/mcp.json"
    ]
    extracted_content = {}
    repo_path = Path(repo_path)
    for root, _, files in os.walk(repo_path):
        for file in files:
            if file in relevant_files:
                file_path = Path(root) / file
                try:
                    content = file_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore")
                    relative_path = str(file_path.relative_to(repo_path))
                    extracted_content[relative_path] = content
                except Exception as e:
                    extracted_content[relative_path] = f"Error reading file: {str(e)}"
    return extracted_content

def create_prompt_from_files(extracted_files):
    prompt = "Extracted MCP repo config files and their content:\n"
    for path, content in extracted_files.items():
        truncated_content = content[:2000]
        prompt += f"\nFile: {path}\nContent:\n{truncated_content}\n---\n"
    prompt += (
        "\nPlease analyze and classify the MCP deployment role (trusted-host-only, standalone, or mixed-use), "
        "list integration targets, and highlight any security-relevant information or configuration risks."
    )
    return prompt

def analyze_with_gemini(repo_path):
    # Extract
    extracted_files = extract_relevant_files(repo_path)
    if not extracted_files:
        print("No relevant config/manifest files found.")
        return ""
    # Build prompt
    prompt = create_prompt_from_files(extracted_files)
    # Configure Gemini client
    client = genai.Client()
    # Call the most cost-efficient model (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-2.5-flash",
        contents=prompt
    )
    print("\nGemini Analysis:\n")
    print(response.text)
    return response.text

# Usage example:
# Place your Gemini API key in the .env or environment: GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxx
# Call the function:
# analyze_with_gemini('/path/to/your/mcp-repo')
```


## Usage Notes

- Place your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the environment (e.g., using a `.env` file or `export GEMINI_API_KEY=...`).
- The script collects all key MCP config/manifest files in the repo (even nested).
- The generated prompt provides maximum context for Gemini to reason about the MCP integration in a single efficient call.
- The model is set to `gemini-2.5-flash`, which is the best balance of cost and reasoning according to current public resources[^37_1][^37_2][^37_3][^37_4].
- If you want to process code or larger files, consider further truncating or summarizing contents before sending (to control token usage/cost).


## Model Selection and Costs

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** is optimized for speed and efficiency, balancing cost and reasoning performance. Pricing is orders of magnitude lower than larger LLMs, and it's recommended for most analysis and summarization needs[^37_1][^37_2][^37_3][^37_4].
- If your org is especially price-sensitive, monitor new releases for "Flash-Lite" and similar options, but `gemini-2.5-flash` provides the best blend of value and effectiveness as of July 2025.

This script will help automate and scale MCP repository context analysis, integrating the latest capabilities of Google Gemini for efficient, intelligent repository reviews[^37_5][^37_6][^37_1].

] I have now implemented logic to identify role, trusted-host-only - Uses stdio communication, designed for trusted hosts like Claude Desktop

2. standalone - Network-based server with authentication, can run independently
3. mixed-use - Supports multiple deployment modes (both stdio and network)
4. trusted-host-only-unconfirmed - Declared as server but no auth detected
5. unknown - Unable to determine deployment type how can we modify te rule so it accounts for role

Great question—and now is the perfect time to **make your Semgrep rules "role-aware"**.

Since you've implemented logic to **detect the MCP deployment role** (trusted-host-only, standalone, mixed-use, etc.), you can integrate this output into your Semgrep scanning/scoring pipeline to **conditionally apply or suppress** rules based on that role.

## ✅ Goal

Modify rule enforcement logic **based on detected deployment role**, so that, for example:

- 🔒 Rules like `mcp-js-missing-auth` or `mcp-js-insecure-transport` are:
    - **Enforced strictly** for `standalone` or `mixed-use`
    - **Suppressed or flagged as informational** for `trusted-host-only`
    - **Warned but not failed** for `trusted-host-only-unconfirmed`


## ✳️ 1. Semgrep Itself Can’t Fully Enforce Role-Conditioned Logic

Semgrep is intentionally **stateless and local** inside the rule YAML files—it does not support advanced features like:

- Conditional patterns based on dynamic repo metadata (`mcp-role`)
- Importing global repo context gathered outside the rule itself
- Enabling/disabling rules based on external JSON state

**So the right solution is: Handle this logic in your orchestration layer**, _not in the Semgrep rule files themselves_.

## 🧠 2. Add Role Awareness in Your Python Orchestrator Script

Here’s how:

### Step 1: Run Your `detect_role()` Script First

Call this before `semgrep scan`.

```python
repo_role = detect_role(repo_path)
```

This will return one of:

- `trusted-host-only`
- `standalone`
- `mixed-use`
- `trusted-host-only-unconfirmed`
- `unknown`
---

### Step 2: Post-Process Semgrep Results Based on Role

```python
def filter_semgrep_findings_by_role(findings, role):
    filtered = []
    for finding in findings:
        check_id = finding["check_id"]
        severity = finding["extra"]["severity"]

        # Example: skip or downgrade auth rules for trusted-host-only
        if role == "trusted-host-only" and "missing-auth" in check_id:
            continue  # Or optionally downgrade severity to info
        if role == "trusted-host-only" and "insecure-transport" in check_id:
            continue
        if role.startswith("trusted-host") and "rate-limit" in check_id:
            continue

        # Always include for standalone/mixed
        filtered.append(finding)
    return filtered
```


### Step 3: Update Your `run_semgrep()` Logic

Update your wrapper script to apply this filtering:

```python
semgrep_results = run_semgrep(repo_path, config_path)
role = detect_role(repo_path)

filtered = filter_semgrep_findings_by_role(semgrep_results.get("results", []), role)

semgrep_results["results"] = filtered
semgrep_results["role"] = role
semgrep_results["passes"] = len(filtered) == 0
```


## 🧰 Optional: Mark Suppressed Findings as Informational

If you don’t want to drop role-suppressed findings completely, keep them but **downgrade their `severity` to `"info"`**, and label them like this:

```python
if role == "trusted-host-only" and "missing-auth" in check_id:
    finding["extra"]["message"] += " [Suppressed due to role: trusted-host-only]"
    finding["extra"]["severity"] = "info"
    filtered.append(finding)
    continue
```


## 📊 Reporting Option

Your final output might look like:

```json
{
  "repo": "mcp-snowflake-server",
  "role": "standalone",
  "semgrep_findings": [
    {
      "check_id": "mcp-js-missing-auth",
      "severity": "high",
      "message": "MCP endpoint lacks authentication...",
      "path": "app/server.js",
      "line": 42
    }
  ],
  "suppressed": [],
  "score": 720
}
```


## 🆚 Why Not Encode Role into Semgrep YAML?

Semgrep rule conditions are based on **code structure only**. To make deployment-based decisions, it is:

- **Better** to post-process results based on detected role.
- **Faster and more flexible** when handled in code.


## ✅ Summary

| Problem | Solution |
| :-- | :-- |
| Semgrep can’t detect role | Use `detect_role()` before scanning |
| Suppress false positives | Post-process results based on role |
| Customize thresholds \& policy | Adjust scoring logic in orchestration |
| Keep signal, lower noise | Downgrade irrelevant findings to `"info"` |

## 🧪 Next Step

Let me know if you'd like:

- A complete `score_semgrep_results(score, role)` function
- GitHub Actions pipeline integration
- CI indexing of role+score pairs per repo

You’ve already built the key piece: role classification. Use it to make Semgrep smarter 💡

# Should You Create Role-Specific Semgrep Rule Sets for MCP?

## Overview

For Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations, adjusting security checks and policies based on the deployment role—such as "trusted-host-only," "standalone," or "mixed-use"—is both an effective and scalable approach. Engineering your orchestration tool to select or apply the most relevant checks for each role leads to more accurate findings, fewer false positives, and clearer compliance reporting.

## Why Role-Specific Rulesets Make Sense

- **Precision:** Many security findings (e.g., missing authentication) are irrelevant for trusted-host-only plugins but critical for standalone servers.
- **Noise Reduction:** Suppressing irrelevant checks in internal-only repos reduces alert fatigue and helps teams focus on real risks.
- **Policy Customization:** Enterprises may require much stricter controls for externally exposed MCPs (standalone, mixed-use) than for internal only.
- **Audit Clarity:** Reports and scoring are easier to interpret when reviewers know exactly which checks were applied and why.


## Practical Implementation

### 1. Develop Separate Rule Sets or Rule Groups

- **Trusted-Host-Only**
    - Suppress or downgrade checks for authentication, network exposure, and rate limiting.
    - Prioritize checks for prompt logging, config integrity, and host manifest correctness.
- **Standalone / Mixed-Use**
    - Enforce all network, authentication, encryption, and API checks.
    - Require strict validation of inputs, outputs, session handling, and supply chain hygiene.


### 2. Orchestration Layer Logic

- **Detect Role Upfront:** Analyze the repo as part of the pipeline, set a role label.
- **Apply Appropriate Rule Set:**
    - Run Semgrep with rules or rule groups that match the determined role.
    - Optionally, run a full scan but filter findings by role post-hoc.


### 3. Example Workflow

| Detected Role | Rule Set Applied | Example Checks |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| trusted-host-only | trusted_host_rules.yaml | Manifest checks, prompt logging, config integrity |
| standalone | server_rules.yaml | Full security suite: auth, network, dangerous code, rate limiting |
| mixed-use | server_rules.yaml + extra | Union of trusted and server; stricter policy |

### 4. Benefits for Scoring and Enforcement

Role-specific checks make your security scoring much fairer and more actionable. By ensuring only context-relevant issues affect scores and gating, you align remediation effort with true risk.

## Recommendations

- **Maintain distinct rule sets or tag rules by intended context.**
- **Automate role detection in CI/CD** so orchestration tools consistently select the right checks.
- **Document** in each MCP repo which rules and context were in effect during scanning, preserving audit traceability.


## Conclusion

Creating and applying role-specific Semgrep rules, orchestrated according to detected MCP deployment context, is a recommended pattern for scalable, precise, and risk-aligned security automation in modern AI-integrated environments. This approach not only reduces unnecessary findings but also ensures full accountability for critical exposure scenarios.

# Role-Specific Semgrep Rules for MCP Integrations

Below you’ll find **detailed, annotated Semgrep rules** for each core MCP deployment role:

1. **Trusted-Host-Only**
2. **Standalone**
3. **Mixed-Use**
4. **Trusted-Host-Only-Unconfirmed**
5. **Unknown**

Each rule is tailored to the relevant risks and context for that specific role, and includes YAML with explanation of why it applies and what it detects.

## 1. Trusted-Host-Only

**Context:**
Repo exclusively designed for tightly controlled environments such as Claude, Amazon Q, Cursor, etc. Security (auth, permissions, context) is enforced at the host level; internal STDIO or local mechanisms only.

### a) Host Manifest/Config Integrity

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-host-manifest-integrity
  message: "Manifest/configuration for MCP plugin may be missing required fields ('role', 'integration_target')."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  paths:
    include:
      - "mcp.json"
      - "manifest.json"
      - "tool-manifest.json"
  pattern: |
    { ... }
  metadata:
    category: config
    explanation: |
      Ensures strict config discipline. Even host-only plugins must declare their intended context, for auditability and CI/CD enforcement.
    role: trusted-host-only
```


### b) Prompt Logging Required

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-prompt-logging-missing
  message: "Prompt logging not detected; host cannot reconstruct user/tool actions for audit."
  severity: medium
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  pattern-not-inside: |
    logPrompt(...)
  metadata:
    category: audit
    explanation: |
      Host integrations must log prompts and tool calls for forensic, compliance and debugging purposes, even though they're never directly user-facing.
    role: trusted-host-only
```


### c) Prohibit Direct Network Exposure

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-trustedhost-network-exposure
  message: "Plugin/server exposes network endpoints unexpectedly for a host-only integration."
  severity: critical
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
    - pattern: server.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
  metadata:
    category: config
    explanation: |
      Host-only plugins must never bind to external interfaces. Their communication is strictly local/STDIO.
    role: trusted-host-only
```


## 2. Standalone

**Context:**
Repo is intended to be deployed as a public, externally reachable MCP server. It must enforce its own security and operational controls.

### a) Missing Authentication or Authorization

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-missing-auth-standalone
  message: "Standalone MCP endpoint lacks any authentication or RBAC control."
  severity: critical
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        app.$METHOD($ROUTE, $HANDLER)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        if (req.headers.authorization)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        authenticate(...)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        authorize(...)
  metadata:
    category: security
    explanation: |
      All publicly accessible servers must protect endpoints against unauthorized use, abuse, and data leakage.
    role: standalone
```


### b) Insecure Transport or Certificate Verification

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-insecure-transport-standalone
  message: "Standalone MCP server launched without TLS or disables certificate verification."
  severity: critical
  languages: [javascript, typescript]

```


## 3. Mixed-Use

**Context:**
Repo supports both local/trusted-host and standalone/external use, often switchable by env/config.

### a) Dual-Mode Auth Detection

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-auth-mixed-use
  message: "MCP endpoint does not conditionally enforce authentication in standalone/network mode."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:

  metadata:
    category: security
    explanation: |
      When used in network mode, MCP must enable transport security. In host mode, rule is relaxed.
    role: mixed-use
```


## 4. Trusted-Host-Only-Unconfirmed

**Context:**
Declared as a server, but no network auth detected and ambiguous exposure. Highlight for security review.

### a) Ambiguous Exposure Review

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-ambiguous-server-exposure
  message: "Server declared, but neither explicit authentication nor host restriction detected. Manual review required."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.$METHOD($ROUTE, $HANDLER)
    - pattern-not-inside: req.headers.authorization
    - pattern-not-inside: authenticate(...)
    - pattern-not-inside: authorize(...)
  metadata:
    category: security
    explanation: |
      Server apps lacking clear auth/binding could be accidentally exposed and should be reviewed or locked down immediately.
    role: trusted-host-only-unconfirmed
```


## 5. Unknown

**Context:**
Unable to determine deployment context; enforce safe defaults and require manifest clarification.

### a) Require Role Declaration

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-missing-role-declaration
  message: "Repo lacks explicit role/integration_target manifest fields. Add 'role' to manifest/config."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  paths:
    include:
      - "mcp.json"
      - "manifest.json"
      - "tool-manifest.json"
  pattern-not: |
    "role":
  metadata:
    category: config
    explanation: |
      All MCP integrations must declare their intended deployment role for automation and compliance purposes.
    role: unknown
```


### b) Conservative Security Controls

Apply a **union of all high/critical risk checks** as in the “standalone” set until the repo is updated to clarify its context.

## Summary Table

| Role | Unique Enforcement Focus | Example Rule IDs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Trusted-Host-Only | Manifest fields, prompt logging, ban network bind | mcp-js-host-manifest-integrity, ... |
| Standalone | Full web security: auth, transport, session handling | mcp-js-missing-auth-standalone, ... |
| Mixed-Use | Conditional checks, dual-mode logic enforcement | mcp-js-auth-mixed-use, ... |
| Trusted-Host-Only-Unconfirmed | Flag ambiguous code for review | mcp-js-ambiguous-server-exposure |
| Unknown | Require explicit role, conservative defaults enforced | mcp-js-missing-role-declaration |

**All rule examples are annotated inline to aid implementation and review. Add, refine, or adjust rules per organizational risk policy and evolving MCP guidance.**

---

# Are These the Full Rules?

## Short Answer

No, the rules provided are **comprehensive and well-annotated for major role-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployment scenarios**, but they do **not cover every possible risk or configuration** found in the full MCP specification or the broader domain of secure MCP operations.

## What the Rules Cover

The role-specific examples you received cover:

- Trusted-host-only deployments (host-manifest integrity, prompt logging, avoiding network bind)
- Standalone deployments (authentication, transport security, rate limiting, session handling)
- Mixed-use deployments (conditional auth/transport checks)
- Trusted-host-only-unconfirmed (ambiguous exposure, highlight for review)
- Unknown role (require explicit declaration, apply conservative defaults)

Each rule is annotated and targeted at the most immediately relevant risks for the given deployment scenario.

## What Might Be Missing

1. **Additional MCP Security Concerns:**
    - Advanced supply chain and dependency checks
    - Fine-grained authorization/role checks and permission scoping
    - Detection of prompt injection risk surfaces in tool/resource descriptions
    - Audit log management and forensic readiness requirements
    - Input/output validation for agent-tool communication beyond exposed endpoints
    - Detailed error handling and secrets-in-memory checks
2. **Language- and Framework-Specific Patterns:**
    - Rules customized for specific MCP frameworks (e.g., Go, Python, Java) beyond JS/Node/TypeScript examples
    - Coverage for RPC, SSE, websockets, or alternative transports
    - Weaker signal or edge-case exploit scenarios (e.g., race conditions, sandbox escape, privilege escalation bugs)
3. **Integration with Policy, Pipeline, and Scoring:**
    - Orchestration guidance for merging or selecting rule sets based on organizational or deployment policy
    - Support for automatically updating or injecting new rules as MCP standards evolve

## Recommendation

- **Treat provided rules as a strong foundation.** For full coverage, supplement with:
    - Official MCP threat model updates
    - Regulatory or enterprise-specific requirements
    - Rules from trusted Semgrep registries or internal security teams
    - Ongoing review and enrichment for emerging threats or new MCP features

**Summary:**
The rules shown are detailed and practical for establishing role-aware, risk-prioritized MCP security scanning. For full compliance with the complete MCP specification and coverage of all real-world edge cases, continue expanding and refining your rule libraries as new threats and deployment patterns emerge.

# Gaps in Your Current Python Rule Set Detectable by Semgrep

Creating a robust MCP Python security rule set is a strong start, but several high-impact security issues within the scope of static analysis and Semgrep's detection capabilities may not be covered by your existing rules. Addressing these gaps will improve your coverage, reduce risk, and make your security review more defensible.

## 1. OWASP Top 10 Classes Not Fully Addressed

- **SQL Injection**
Detection of unsanitized user input in SQL queries (`f"...{user_input}..."` in SQL execution, use of `format` or string concatenation with DB).
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
Especially in Flask/Django apps: combining user input with HTML responses without escaping.
- **Command Injection**
Unsanitized input in calls like `os.system`, `subprocess.call`, or shell execution via backticks.


## 2. Hardcoded Secrets and Credentials

- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens, or secrets in source code, configs, or environment variables (`password = "..."`, etc.)[^42_1].
- Detection of secrets with names matching patterns like `API_KEY`, `SECRET`, `TOKEN`[^42_1].


## 3. Insecure Use of Cryptography

- Use of outdated or unsafe algorithms (`md5`, `sha1`, `DES`, `RC4`)[^42_2].
- Weak key management patterns.
- Missing `os.urandom`/`secrets` for cryptographic randomness.


## 4. Insecure File and Path Handling

- User-controlled input used in file paths (potential path traversal: `open(request.args["filename"], ...)`).
- Unsafe use of `pickle.load` or `yaml.load` without specifying a safe loader is known, but unsafe use of `tempfile` or insecure file permissions are often missed[^42_3].


## 5. Unsafe YAML and Deserialization Patterns

- `yaml.load()` without safe loader, or using outdated deserialization methods.
- Extending to other third-party deserializers beyond `pickle`, e.g., `cerealizer`, `PyYAML`, `marshmallow`.


## 6. Third-Party Dependency Risks

- Use of packages with known CVEs or unpinned dependencies[^42_2].
- Imports or installation of outdated libraries, detected by looking for old version numbers or the use of `"*"` in requirements files.


## 7. Default Mutable Arguments and Common Python Bugs

- Functions defined with mutable default arguments (e.g., `def f(x=[])`), leading to unexpected shared state[^42_1].
- Use of `==`/`!=` with `None` instead of `is`/`is not`.


## 8. HTTP(s) Security Misconfigurations

- `requests.get(..., verify=False)` (certificate verification).
- Servers started with weak or missing TLS settings across frameworks.


## 9. Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization

- Absence of validation for user-supplied input before use in sensitive functions (beyond just authentication).
- Failure to use libraries such as `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` for upload handling.


## 10. Incomplete Taint Analysis

- Many dangerous sinks and sources go beyond simple pattern checks: user input passed through intermediate variables into dangerous functions can be identified with Semgrep's taint mode, which may not be fully leveraged in basic pattern rules[^42_4].


## 11. Error and Exception Handling

- Missing or improper error handling revealing stack traces or sensitive information to end users.
- Overly broad `except Exception:` or silent exception swallowing.


## Example: Coverage Gaps Compared to Bandit

A gap analysis between Semgrep and Bandit found these commonly missed areas in Semgrep-only rulesets:

- Detection of secrets in configuration paths, backups, and resource files;
- Extra coverage for SQL Injection, unsafe cryptographic APIs, and Django/Flask-specific patterns;
- Templating/jinja2 misconfigurations[^42_1][^42_5].


## Table: Key Categories Often Missed

| Risk Area | Example Issue | Covered by Default Bandit | Covered by Core Semgrep Rules | Easy to Add? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Hardcoded secrets | password/token = "..." | Yes | Not always | Yes |
| Insecure crypto | use of md5, sha1, etc. | Yes | Not by default | Yes |
| Path traversal/input join | open(user_input), os.path.join(user_input) | Yes | Not always | Yes |
| Mutable default arg | def f(x=[]) | Yes | Sometimes | Yes |
| Exception handling | bare except, info leak | Yes | Not always | Yes |
| Unquoted shell exec | subprocess.call(user_input) | Yes | Not always | Yes |
| Templating issues | Flask/Jinja unescaped HTML | Limited | Sometimes via Pro/community | Yes |

## Recommendations

- **Supplement your current MCP ruleset with Bandit and Semgrep community Python security rulesets**, especially for the categories above, or port relevant Bandit rules into Semgrep format for unified scanning[^42_6][^42_1].
- **Use Semgrep's taint mode and advanced pattern features** (multi-pattern, pattern-either) to address data flow from user input to dangerous sinks[^42_4].
- **Standardize checks for secret leaks and dependency risks** using Semgrep’s supply chain and secrets rule bundles[^42_7][^42_2].
- **Tailor rules to your framework and codebase**—Semgrep shines at quickly prototyping rules for emerging weaknesses and code idioms[^42_8][^42_1].

**In summary:** While your current rules provide a good MCP base, gaps remain in areas like hardcoded secrets, crypto misuse, path traversal, improper exception handling, input validation, certain dependency risks, and advanced taint tracking. Expanding into these areas leverages Semgrep's full static analysis power for Python security[^42_5][^42_6][^42_1].

# Python MCP Rule Set Coverage: Focusing on Semgrep

## Scope

You’ve indicated that Truffle ov-scan handles detection for secrets, credentials, and supply-chain risks (such as hardcoded keys, exposed tokens, and unsafe dependency versions). Below is a focused summary of key security gaps and bug classes that **Semgrep** can and should address for MCP Python projects—excluding duplicate coverage with ov-scan.

## Areas Where Semgrep Excels—Beyond Secrets and Supply Chain

### Injection \& Taint Risks

- **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized or user-controlled input in SQL queries (via string concatenation or f-strings) in database access calls.
- **Command Injection:** Passing user input directly to process execution functions (`os.system`, `subprocess.call`, `Popen`, etc.).
- **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Use of `pickle.load`, `yaml.load` without a safe loader, or any third-party deserialization relying on user input.


### Dynamic Code Execution

- **Unsafe Use of `eval`, `exec`, `compile`:** Patterns matching direct execution of user-controllable input.


### Agent/LLM Surface Issues (MCP-Relevant)

- **Prompt Injection Surfaces in Code/Manifests:** Unsanitized input passed into MCP tool/resource descriptors, especially dynamic tool descriptions for LLM agents.
- **Open Exposure of Tool Capabilities:** Tools/resources that can trigger system changes or external requests without appropriate validation/checks.


### HTTP(s) \& Network Security

- **Insecure Network Bindings:** Servers binding to `0.0.0.0` or port configurations that expose APIs to unexpected sources.
- **Missing Origin/Host Validation:** Absence of checks for `Origin`/`Host` headers in HTTP routes.
- **Certificate Verification Disabled:** Checking for `verify=False` in `requests`, custom TLS handling, or Flask/Quart servers lacking HTTPS.


### Input/Output \& Data Validation

- **Unvalidated User Input in Critical Paths:** Data passed from web handlers or agent calls into sensitive functions without checks—beyond secrets.
- **File Path Traversal:** User input used in file paths without sanitization.
- **Improper Validation for Command-Line or Environment Variables:** Input received from external scripts/config without type/format checks.


### Session, Authorization, and Business Logic Flaws

- **Missing Session Termination:** Endpoints or flows that lack logout/revoke token/session destruction logic.
- **Improper or Missing Authorization Checks:** Business actions or resource access paths lacking RBAC or permission guardrails.
- **Unsafe Session/Token Generation:** Use of non-cryptographic randomness in session IDs or tokens (`random.random()`, etc.).


### Error Handling \& Information Disclosure

- **Overly Broad Exception Handling:** Bare `except:` or `except Exception:` blocks, which can hide bugs or security flaws.
- **Revealing Stack Traces/Errors to Users:** Application leaks internal info via error messages or tracebacks in responses.


### Python Idioms \& Bugs

- **Mutable Default Arguments:** Functions defined with mutable defaults (e.g., `def f(x=[])`).
- **Comparison to `None` with `==`/`!=` instead of `is`/`is not`.**


## What Not to Duplicate (Covered by ov-scan)

- Hardcoded secrets (keys, tokens, passwords)
- Unpinned or unsafe dependencies
- Exposure of secrets in config or resource files


## Key Table: Where Semgrep Adds Value in MCP Context

| Risk/Category | Semgrep Rule Example | Reliance on ov-scan? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| SQL/command/code injection | `os.system(user_input)`, `eval(...)` | Semgrep only |
| HTTP/network misbinding | `app.run(host="0.0.0.0")`, missing TLS | Semgrep only |
| Prompt/descriptor injection surfaces | `tool.description = user_input` | Semgrep only |
| Unsafe deserialization | `pickle.load`/`yaml.load` (w/o safe loader) | Semgrep only |
| Authorization/session flaws | Route missing RBAC, session issues | Semgrep only |
| Python anti-patterns | Mutable defaults, exception handling bugs | Semgrep only |
| Hardcoded secrets/supply chain | N/A (ov-scan covers) | Ignore in Semgrep |

## Summary

- Use ov-scan for secrets, credentials, and supply-chain safety.
- Use Semgrep to detect injection risks, HTTP/network config flaws, unsafe code execution, improper session/auth logic, and code anti-patterns—especially those specific to Python and MCP agent/tool surfaces.
- Excluding duplicate checks maximizes coverage and reduces both tool overlap and alert fatigue.
- Continue expanding Semgrep rules for taint-tracking (user input → sink), business logic gaps, and Python-idiom bugs that static secret scanners will not detect.

# now give me the rules by role and include teh above where appropate

Absolutely! Below is a detailed, structured **role-based Semgrep rule set** for MCP Python projects. This includes:

✅ Existing role-specific logic (trusted-host-only, standalone, mixed-use, etc.)
✅ Coverage gaps Semgrep can fill (injection, insecure transport, unsafe deserialization, etc.)
✅ Excludes overlaps with Truffle/OV-scan (e.g., secrets, pinning)

# ✅ Role-Specific Semgrep Rules for MCP (Python)

## 🟢 1. `trusted-host-only`

📌 Context:

- Only used inside trusted agents (Claude, Q, etc.)

    logging.info("Prompt" ...)  # Simplified: encourage custom logging pattern
  metadata:
    category: audit
    role: trusted-host-only
```


## 🟡 2. `standalone`

📌 Context:

- Public or semi-public MCP endpoint
- Must implement full RBAC, session controls, HTTPS, etc.


### ✅ Rules for this role:

### a) Missing authentication or RBAC

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-missing-auth
  message: "Publicly exposed route lacks authentication or RBAC enforcement."
  severity: critical
  languages: [python]
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        @app.route(...)
        def $FUNC(...):
            ...
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        if "Authorization" in request.headers
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        @require_auth

  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        @app.route(...)
        def $FUNC(...):
            ...
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        @limiter.limit(...)
    metadata:
      category: security
      role: standalone
```


### d) Unsafe input in system functions

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-shell-injection
  message: "Unvalidated user input used in a shell/system command."
  severity: critical
  languages: [python]
  patterns:
    - pattern: subprocess.call($USER_INPUT, shell=True)
    - pattern: os.system($USER_INPUT)
  metadata:
    category: injection
    role: standalone
```


### e) Missing session/token termination

        session.pop(...)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        revoke_token(...)
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: standalone
```


## 🟠 3. `mixed-use`

📌 Context:

- Supports both trusted-host-only mode and public/standalone via `MCP_MODE` or env flags
- Checks must enforce security in external mode but relax in internal mode


### ✅ Rules for this role:

### a) Conditional authentication check must exist

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-conditional-auth-missing
  message: "MCP server supports public access but lacks mode-check-based authentication."
  severity: high
  languages: [python]
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        @app.route(...)
        def $FUNC(...):
            ...
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        if os.environ.get("MCP_MODE") == "standalone":
            if "Authorization" in request.headers:
                ...
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: mixed-use
```


### b) Role-based TLS must be conditional

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-conditional-tls-disabled
  message: "Transport encryption not toggled based on MCP mode."
  severity: high
  languages: [python]
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        if os.environ["MCP_MODE"] == "standalone":
            app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        app.run(..., ssl_context=...)
  metadata:
    category: transport
    role: mixed-use
```


## 🔶 4. `trusted-host-only-unconfirmed`

📌 Context:

- Declares itself as `role: server` but lacks clarity on auth, transport, or exposure
- Escalated to manual review


### ✅ Rule: Flag low-visibility exposure with no authentication

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-flag-ambiguous-server
  message: "Server route detected with no authentication or access restriction — role unclear."
  severity: high
  languages: [python]
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        @app.route(...)
        def $FUNC(...):
            ...
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        if "Authorization" in request.headers
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: trusted-host-only-unconfirmed
```


## ❓ 5. `unknown`

📌 Context:

- No manifest or environment context detected
- Enforce all safe-by-default rules


### ✅ Rule: Require manifest declaration of role

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-missing-role-config
  message: "MCP manifest does not declare 'role'. This is required."
  severity: high
  languages: [python]
  paths:
    include:
      - "mcp.json"
      - "tool-manifest.json"
  pattern-not: |
    "role":
  metadata:
    category: config
    role: unknown
```


### ✅ Rule: Conservative defaults — prohibit 0.0.0.0

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-insecure-default-binding
  message: "No role detected and app exposed to 0.0.0.0 — deny by policy."
  severity: critical
  languages: [python]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: unknown
```


## 🔁 Summary: Rule Volume by Role

| Role | Core Rules | Focus |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `trusted-host-only` | 3–4 | Prevent exposure; enforce config/logging discipline |
| `standalone` | 6–8 | Full-stack security: auth, transport, I/O, session |
| `mixed-use` | 2–3 | Enforce conditional security logic |
| `trusted-host-only-unconfirmed` | 1–2 | Escalate ambiguous/no-auth servers |
| `unknown` | 2–3 | Secure defaults + mandatory declaration |

✅ These rules can be grouped into separate files (e.g. `trusted-host-rules.yaml`, `standalone-rules.yaml`, etc.)
✅ Your orchestration script should filter or load them dynamically based on `detect_role()`
✅ All rules are Semgrep-compatible YAML, manually written to avoid duplicating work covered by Truffle/ov-scan

Let me know if you'd like these rules exported as individual YAML files or bundled in a role-based folder layout!

# FICO-Like Security Scoring Model for Semgrep Outputs

## Overview

This model assigns a quantitative “credit score”-style security grade to each repo, leveraging both MCP-specific role-aware rules and the full set of Semgrep findings. The approach reflects best practices for enterprise security rating methodologies, such as FICO and SecurityScorecard, weighting findings by risk and specificity to your environment[^45_1][^45_2][^45_3].

## Scoring Methodology

### 1. Score Range

- **Maximum score:** 850 (best attainable posture)
- **Minimum score:** 300 (systemic risk)
- **Passing thresholds:**
    - 800–850: Excellent
    - 740–799: Very Good
    - 670–739: Good
    - 580–669: Fair
    - 300–579: Poor


### 2. Finding Severity Weights

Each finding deducts points from the score:


| Severity | Global Semgrep Finding | MCP-Specific Finding (extra weight) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Critical | -120 | -160  (adds -40 per) |
| High | -80 | -120  (adds -40 per) |
| Medium | -40 | -60   (adds -20 per) |
| Low | -10 | -10 |

- When a finding is triggered by both MCP and generic rules, only the highest penalty applies (no double deduction).


### 3. Calculation Steps

- **Sum the deduction** for each finding by severity, using MCP weight if the rule is MCP-specific and relevant for deployment role.
- **Subtract the total deduction** from the base score of 850.
- If the score falls below 300, cap at 300.
- If >10 findings are at Critical/High, cap at 579 ("Poor") regardless of raw score.
- Optionally, rules suppressed or downgraded by deployment role are excluded or treated as “info” only.


### 4. Sample Calculation

For these findings:

- 2 × Critical MCP finding
- 5 × High severity (non-MCP)
- 10 × Medium MCP
- 3 × Low (any rule)

Score = 850 – (2×160 + 5×80 + 10×60 + 3×10)
= 850 – (320 + 400 + 600 + 30)
= **300** (caps at floor)

## Sample Reporting Table

| Severity | MCP? | Count | Deduction per | Total Deduction |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Critical | Yes | 2 | -160 | -320 |
| High | No | 5 | -80 | -400 |
| Medium | Yes | 10 | -60 | -600 |
| Low | No | 3 | -10 | -30 |
|  |  |  | **Total:** | **-1350** |

- Final Score (capped): **300**


## Integrating with Full Semgrep Scans

- **Full Semgrep results** are included in the deduction calculation—every qualifying finding reduces the score by its weighted value.
- **MCP findings** (from specialized, role-aware rules) get additional deduction, prioritizing protocol and business-specific risk.
- **Role detection**: The orchestrator script determines which rules apply based on the identified deployment context, ensuring only relevant findings affect the score.
- **Suppressed findings**: Findings irrelevant to context (e.g., missing auth in trusted-host-only) are excluded from deduction but may be reported as “info”.


## Guidance

- Maintain a results sheet showing: detected role, all findings by severity and MCP/origination, scoring steps, and final score.
- Improve scores by remediating “critical” and “high” risk findings first—these cause the largest deduction.
- Document scoring method and role-awareness for clear audit and compliance reporting.

# Scoring Custom MCP Semgrep Rule Findings

## Overview

Each finding produced by your custom, role-aware MCP Semgrep rules directly affects your repository’s FICO-like security score. The system is designed to reflect both the severity and the risk relevancy of each finding, especially for MCP-critical issues.

## Scoring Methodology

### 1. Base Score

- Every repository scan starts with a **base score of 850**.


### 2. Deduction Table

Findings deduct points based on severity and whether the rule is MCP-specific:


| Severity | Generic Rule Deduction | MCP-Specific Rule Deduction* |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Critical | –120 | –160 |
| High | –80 | –120 |
| Medium | –40 | –60 |
| Low | –10 | –10 |

\* MCP-Specific Rule Deduction includes an extra penalty to emphasize protocol compliance and business risk.

- Only the **highest penalty** is applied per finding if matched by both an MCP and a generic rule.


### 3. Scoring Steps

- Total deductions are calculated for all findings.
- Subtract the sum from 850.
- Minimum floor is **300**.
- If more than 10 critical/high findings, final score is capped at **579** (“Poor”).

**Example:**

- 1 Critical MCP finding = –160
- 2 High (generic) findings = –160
- 3 Medium MCP findings = –180
- 2 Low (any rule) findings = –20

**Score:** 850 – (160+160+180+20) = **330**

### 4. Interpretation Table

| Score Range | Security Level | Guidance |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 800–850 | Excellent | Ship/approve |
| 740–799 | Very Good | Minor fixes |
| 670–739 | Good | Proactive fixes |
| 580–669 | Fair | Review/remediate |
| 300–579 | Poor | Critical fail |

### 5. Role-Based Application

- Only findings **relevant to the detected deployment role** impact the score.
- Suppressed findings (e.g., authentication warnings for trusted-host-only) are not included in deduction but may be reported as informational.


### 6. Reporting

For transparency, your report should include:


| Rule ID | Severity | MCP-Specific | Deduction |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| mcp-py-missing-auth | Critical | Yes | –160 |
| mcp-py-shell-injection | Critical | Yes | –160 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **Total** |  |  | –XX |

Final Score: **850 – Total Deduction**

## Summary

To score your custom rule findings:

- Assign points lost per finding using the severity and MCP weighting above.
- Apply deductions only for role-relevant findings.
- Subtract total from 850 for the repo’s security score.
- Interpret results using the provided banding for risk management and remediation.

This approach ensures consistent, transparent, and risk-aligned security scoring across all MCP and general Semgrep findings.

  message: "MCP server supports public access but lacks mode-check-based authentication."
  severity: high
  languages: [python]
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        @app.route(...)
        def $FUNC(...):

  languages: [python]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: unknown
```

**Severity assignment** is aligned with effective risk:

- `critical`: Direct, external exposure or high impact bug
- `high`: Broken or missing policy/encryption/role config
- `medium`: Audit/compliance/integrity best practices

**This ruleset is now ready to plug into your scoring/orchestration pipeline and supports your FICO-style weighted scoring as discussed.**

# How Your MCP Security \& Semgrep Approach Aligns with MCPEval

## Overview

The VentureBeat article on open-source MCPEval highlights a new industry standard for evaluating MCP (Model Context Protocol) agent performance: a fully automated, protocol-level testing toolkit that benchmarks agents in the same environment in which they will deploy. Your Semgrep-based, role-aware security and compliance checks are a foundational complement to this trend, ensuring that MCP implementations are not only rigorously tested for capability and intent (as MCPEval does), but also for secure and compliant behavior at the code level.

## MCPEval: What It Brings

- **Automated End-to-End Agent Testing:** MCPEval lets users select MCP servers and tools, generates synthetic data and tasks, benchmarks actual agent/tool executions, and evaluates agent performance and behaviors in production-like conditions[^48_1][^48_2].
- **Plug-and-Play Evaluation:** Supports various LLMs, native tools, and is fully open source, giving enterprises rapid, repeatable, and scalable assessment for new MCP agents and server integrations[^48_1][^48_3].
- **Multi-Dimensional Reporting:** Goes beyond simple success/failure by tracking agent actions, tool calls, and interaction trajectories—spotting behavior gaps and informing iterative improvement[^48_2][^48_3].
- **Standardization:** Promotes protocol-level test and evaluation across vendors and environments, making the "how well does my agent/tool actually work" question plug-and-play for the first time[^48_1][^48_3].


## Where Your Semgrep Rules Fit In

### 1. Complementary Layers: What Static Analysis Adds

| MCPEval Focus | Semgrep Role in Your Workflow |
| :-- | :-- |
| Agent performance, task completion, trajectory | Code-level security, correctness, and policy enforcement |
| Tool use, procedural accuracy | Defensive coding, safe tool/resource integration |
| Protocol conformance, agent-environment fit | Static guarantee of authentication, transport, role correctness |

- **MCPEval** answers "Does the agent use tools as intended, and perform robustly in real environments?"
- **Your Semgrep \& security checks** answer "Is the MCP code itself free of mistakes, unsafe exposures, and policy violations—according to deployment role?"


### 2. Security in Context

- **MCPEval** may reveal functionally correct agents that nonetheless would expose security risks if the server code is misconfigured (e.g., missing authentication in standalone deployments). Your Semgrep rules catch these structural security gaps before agents are ever tested by MCPEval.
- By detecting and enforcing role-specific boundaries (trusted-host-only, standalone, mixed-use), your approach ensures that only MCPs in sound security posture are subjected to protocol-level benchmarking.


### 3. Standardization and Automation

- MCPEval brings standardized, scalable agent testing; your rule-centric code analysis brings standardized, automatable security gatekeeping. Together, they support reproducible, fully auditable end-to-end QA.


## How MCPEval and Your Rules Work Together

1. **Development/CI Stage:**
    - Your Semgrep rules and deployment-role detection run early, blocking/flagging insecure or misdeclared MCP code before prototyping or evaluation.
2. **Pre-Deployment/QA:**
    - MCPEval benchmarks only those MCP tools/servers that pass static security checks, ensuring protocol- and enterprise-grade QA.
3. **Continuous Security \& Evaluation:**
    - Both approaches can run continuously post-deployment: MCPEval watches for live agent drift, while your rules verify that code changes do not undermine the intended trust boundary or critical controls.

## Opportunity \& Future Integration

- **Unified QA Pipeline:** Enterprises can integrate code-based Semgrep security reviews and MCPEval's agent-centric dynamic evaluations into a single pipeline—guaranteeing not just functional, but secure and correct MCP deployments.
- **Standardization Across the Stack:** Your emphasis on manifest clarity, deployment-context detection, and role-aware gating lays the groundwork for MCPEval-compatible MCP implementations, future-proofing your security regime as protocol-level agent testing becomes the norm[^48_2][^48_3].


## Conclusion

Your custom, role-aware Semgrep model directly supports and complements what MCPEval and the wider community are now delivering:

- Automated, protocol-level, context-sensitive evaluation for MCP-based agents.
- Fast, reproducible, scalable compliance—enforced both statically (on code) and dynamically (in agent testing and interaction flow)[^48_1][^48_2][^48_3].

This dual approach aligns your security program with industry-leading dev/test and deployment practices for MCP-based AI agents.

## Official GitHub Repo for MCPEval

The primary open-source repository for **MCPEval**, an automated protocol-level evaluation framework for Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents and tools, is:

- **Repository:** [dylibso/mcpx-eval](https://github.com/dylibso/mcpx-eval)

This repo provides a framework for evaluating tool use across various large language models and MCP-enabled servers, offering plug-and-play benchmarking and comparison functionality. You can install it via `uv tool install mcpx-eval` or clone directly from GitHub[^49_1].

Additionally, related work on multilingual code benchmarking with a similar name (**McEval**) can be found here, though its focus is on code generation and evaluation rather than MCP protocol agent testing:

- [MCEVAL/McEval](https://github.com/MCEVAL/McEval)[^49_2]

For MCPEval as referenced in recent protocol-level benchmarking articles, the dylibso/mcpx-eval repository is the primary project.

# Now give me the same rules for JavaScript

Absolutely! Here are the **role-specific, annotated Semgrep rules for JavaScript/TypeScript MCP projects**, with **explicit severity assignment** and coverage for the same security classes as the Python example. These YAML snippets are ready to be split into rule files per role and orchestrated using your detected deployment context (trusted-host-only, standalone, mixed-use, etc.).

# 🟢 1. trusted-host-only

**Context:**
Intended to run only inside a trusted agent (like Claude/Q/Copilot). Network exposure and user-facing authentication are NOT expected. Emphasis: Manifest completeness, audit, and prohibiting network listeners.

## a) Manifest must include role/integration fields

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-missing-role-field
  message: "MCP manifest missing 'role' or 'integration_target'."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  paths:
    include: ["mcp.json", "manifest.json", "tool-manifest.json"]
  pattern-not: |
    "role"
  metadata:
    category: config
    role: trusted-host-only
```


## b) Unexpected network exposure (should NOT exist)

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-host-exposed-binding
  message: "Plugin binds to public interface (0.0.0.0) despite being trusted-host-only."
  severity: critical
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
    - pattern: server.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: trusted-host-only
```


## c) Prompt logging absence

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-missing-prompt-logging
  message: "Prompt or tool invocation is not logged for internal audit."
  severity: medium
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  pattern-not-inside: |
    logPrompt(...)
  metadata:
    category: audit
    role: trusted-host-only
```


# 🟡 2. standalone

**Context:**
Externally accessible as a server or service. Requires robust transport, auth, rate limiting, and security checks.

## a) Missing authentication or RBAC

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-missing-auth
  message: "Public route lacks authentication (missing RBAC/enforcement)."
  severity: critical
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.$METHOD($ROUTE, $HANDLER)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        if (req.headers.authorization)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        authenticate(...)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        authorize(...)
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: standalone
```


## b) Insecure transport (no TLS/verify disabled)

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-transport-insecure
  message: "TLS not enforced for standalone MCP: missing HTTPS or disables certificate verification."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
    - pattern: server.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
    - pattern: axios.get($URL, { httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false }) })
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: standalone
```


## c) Missing rate limiting

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-missing-rate-limit
  message: "No rate limiting detected on public endpoints."
  severity: medium
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.$METHOD($ROUTE, $HANDLER)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        rateLimit(...)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        limiter(...)
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: standalone
```


## d) Command injection (through unsafe use of exec/system)

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-shell-injection
  message: "Untrusted input passed to shell/exec function."
  severity: critical
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: child_process.exec($USER_INPUT)
    - pattern: child_process.execSync($USER_INPUT)
    - pattern: require('child_process').spawn($USER_INPUT)
  metadata:
    category: injection
    role: standalone
```


## e) Missing session/token destruction

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-missing-session-destroy
  message: "No endpoint available to destroy/revoke session or token."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.$METHOD($ROUTE, $HANDLER)
    - pattern-not-inside: logout(...)
    - pattern-not-inside: revokeToken(...)
    - pattern-not-inside: req.session.destroy(...)
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: standalone
```


# 🟠 3. mixed-use

**Context:**
Supports both host-only and external/server mode (env toggles or feature flags). Auth/transport enforced only in "standalone" mode.

## a) Conditional authentication missing for network mode

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-conditional-auth-missing
  message: "Conditional (mode-based) authentication missing/incorrect for mixed-use MCP."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.$METHOD($ROUTE, $HANDLER)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        if (process.env.MCP_MODE === "standalone" && req.headers.authorization)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        authenticate(...)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        authorize(...)
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: mixed-use
```


## b) TLS must be enforced in network mode

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-conditional-tls-disabled
  message: "Network mode enabled without enforcing HTTPS/TLS."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        if (process.env.MCP_MODE === "standalone") {
          app.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
        }
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        https.createServer(...)
  metadata:
    category: transport
    role: mixed-use
```


# 🔶 4. trusted-host-only-unconfirmed

**Context:**
Declared as a server, but has no clear authentication or is ambiguous in exposure.

## a) Ambiguous/public server exposure w/ no authentication

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-flag-ambiguous-server
  message: "Server endpoint detected with no authentication or access restriction — unclear if public or host-only. Manual review advised."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.$METHOD($ROUTE, $HANDLER)
    - pattern-not-inside: |
        if (req.headers.authorization)
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: trusted-host-only-unconfirmed
```


# ❓ 5. unknown

**Context:**
Manifest missing or unrecognized; apply strict security defaults.

## a) Manifest must declare role

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-missing-role-config
  message: "MCP manifest does not declare 'role'. This is required for compliance."
  severity: high
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  paths:
    include:
      - "mcp.json"
      - "tool-manifest.json"
  pattern-not: |
    "role":
  metadata:
    category: config
    role: unknown
```


## b) Prevent network binding by default (deny 0.0.0.0)

```yaml
- id: mcp-js-insecure-default-binding
  message: "No role detected and app exposed to 0.0.0.0 — blocked by policy."
  severity: critical
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  patterns:
    - pattern: app.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
    - pattern: server.listen($PORT, "0.0.0.0")
  metadata:
    category: security
    role: unknown
```


## 📋 Severity Key

- **critical**: Immediate external exposure or clear exploit
- **high**: Broken policy/encryption/role
- **medium**: Audit/compliance/integrity (best practice)

**How to use these:**

- Group into YAML files by role (e.g., `standalone-rules.yaml`)
- Orchestrate rule selection/enforcement based on detected deployment context
- Plug results into your FICO-style scoring model as outlined previously

Let me know if you want a zipped repo or GHA workflow with these rules organized per role!

---

# will this work on typescript as well?

Yes, the role-specific Semgrep rules provided above are written to support both **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** out of the box.

### Why These Rules Work on TypeScript

- The `languages: [javascript, typescript]` field in each rule instructs Semgrep to apply the rule to both `.js` and `.ts` (and `.jsx`, `.tsx`) files.
- The patterns target general JavaScript/TypeScript syntax and common Node/Express APIs, which are valid in both languages.
- Most runtime and security patterns (Express routes, network bindings, authentication checks, etc.) use compatible syntax in TypeScript and JavaScript, so the YAML rules are equally effective for either.


### Best Practices/Tips

- If you use advanced TypeScript features (e.g., decorators, interfaces in routes), you may want to add or tune specific patterns to cover new syntax.
- For TypeScript projects, make sure Semgrep indexing includes `.ts` and `.tsx` by specifying the correct file extensions or glob patterns.
- The rules as written will match both TypeScript projects (including those transpiled to JS) and plain JavaScript projects.


### Summary

- **You do not need to create separate rule sets for TypeScript.**
- The supplied rules are immediately compatible with any modern TypeScript MCP repo.
- If you encounter idiomatic TypeScript code constructs not matched by these patterns, you can easily extend the rules with additional patterns tailored to TypeScript syntax.

**In practice:** Keep your rules DRY and language-agnostic wherever reasonable—Semgrep makes multi-language YAML simple as long as the patterns are general!

Let me know if you need examples tuned for advanced TypeScript use cases or configurations!

# Current Problem: The rules expect a manifest file (mcp.json, manifest.json) to declare the deployment mode:

- id: mcp-py-missing-role-field
paths:
include: ["mcp.json", "manifest.json", "tool-manifest.json"]
pattern-not: |
"role"

Reality: None of the real MCP repositories we tested actually have these manifest files. They don't exist in practice.

Solution - Heuristic Detection: The rules should intelligently detect the deployment mode by analyzing code patterns:

# Heuristic examples:

# If we see this pattern → likely TRUSTED-HOST-ONLY:

if uses_stdio_only and no_network_binding and no_auth:
deployment_mode = "trusted-host-only"

# If we see this pattern → likely STANDALONE:

if has_network_binding and has_authentication and uses_tls:
deployment_mode = "standalone"

# If we see this pattern → likely MIXED-USE:

if has_conditional_auth_based_on_config:
deployment_mode = "mixed-use"

Real Examples from Our Test:

- k8s-mcp-server: Uses stdio exclusively → should trigger trusted-host-only rules
- MCP-Bridge: Has FastAPI with configurable auth → should trigger standalone/mixed rules
- esp-mcp: stdio + no auth → should trigger trusted-host-only rules

2. Broader Pattern Matching

Current Problem: Rules look for very specific patterns that don't match real code:

# Current rule looks for this exact pattern:

- pattern: |
@require_auth
@app.route(...)
def \$FUNC(...):

Reality: MCP-Bridge uses different auth patterns:

# MCP-Bridge actually uses:

if config.security.auth.enabled:
\# Apply auth middleware

# Or uses FastAPI dependencies:

def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
\# Validate token

Solution - Broader Patterns: Rules should recognize various authentication implementations:

# Better rule with multiple patterns:

- pattern-either:

# FastAPI style

    - pattern: |
def \$FUNC(..., $USER = Depends($AUTH_FUNC)):


# Config-based auth

    - pattern: |
if \$CONFIG.auth.enabled:


# Header checking

    - pattern: |
if "Authorization" in request.headers:


# API key validation

    - pattern: |
api_key = request.headers.get("X-API-Key")
if not validate_api_key(api_key):

3. Practical Example of Improved Rules

Here's how an improved rule might work:

# Improved rule that combines heuristics and broader patterns

- id: mcp-deployment-mode-detection
patterns:

# First, try to detect deployment mode heuristically

    - patterns:

# Trusted-host-only indicators

        - pattern-either:
            - patterns:
                - pattern: |
stdio.get_stdio_transport()
                - pattern-not: |
app.run(host=...)
            - patterns:
                - pattern: |
async def main():
...
await server.run()
                - pattern-not: |
bind(\$ADDR)


# Then apply appropriate security checks

        - pattern-not: |

# Should NOT have network binding for trusted-host

app.run(host="0.0.0.0")

You're exactly right: **if real MCP repos don't actually have manifest files, then static rules requiring their presence are more noise than signal**—and a pattern- or heuristic-based approach is much better for practical security automation.

Below is a refined and practical approach for Semgrep rules (Python-flavored, but the principles apply cross-language). These rules:

- **Infer MCP deployment mode from actual code patterns** (e.g., stdio/network bindings, authentication, config toggles).
- **Match a wide range of real-world auth/network idioms** (including FastAPI, config toggles, middleware, header checks, etc.).
- **Are broad but targeted, so they surface intent even with variable coding styles.**


# 📐 Practical Heuristic Semgrep Rules for MCP Deployment Mode \& Security

## 1. Heuristic Deployment Mode Detection

### a) Trusted-host-only (stdio**,** no network binding, no auth)

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-heuristic-trusted-host-only
  languages: [python]
  message: "Heuristic: MCP appears to be trusted-host-only (stdio-only, no network/server, no auth detected)."
  severity: info
  patterns:
    - pattern-either:
        # Main loop runs on stdio or subprocess i/o
        - pattern: |
            import sys
            sys.stdin
        - pattern: |
            get_stdio_transport()
        - pattern: |
            $VAR = MCPServer(stdio=...)
    - pattern-not: |
        app.run(host=...)
    - pattern-not: |
        bind("0.0.0.0", ...)
    - pattern-not: |
        if "Authorization" in ...
  metadata:
    deployment_mode: trusted-host-only
    explanation: |
      No evidence of network exposure; only local or stdio communication detected; no direct authentication checks.
```


### b) Standalone (network binding, authentication, TLS)

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-heuristic-standalone
  languages: [python]
  message: "Heuristic: MCP runs as a network server with auth (likely standalone)."
  severity: info
  patterns:
    # Look for network binding
    - pattern-either:
        - pattern: app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
        - pattern: bind("0.0.0.0", ...)
        - pattern: HTTPServer(('', $PORT), $HANDLER)
    # Look for auth, using pattern matching or config
    - pattern-either:
        - pattern: |
            if "Authorization" in request.headers:
        - pattern: |
            def $FUNC(..., $USER = Depends($AUTH_FUNC)):
        - pattern: |
            if config.security.auth.enabled:
        - pattern: |
            api_key = request.headers.get("X-API-Key")
            if not validate_api_key(api_key):
        - pattern: |
            app.add_middleware(AuthMiddleware, ...)
    # Look for transport security/TLS
    - pattern-either:
        - pattern: app.run(ssl_context=...)
        - pattern: HTTPSConnection(...)
        - pattern: requests.get(..., verify=True)
  metadata:
    deployment_mode: standalone
    explanation: |
      Detected as public or server-accessible MCP; network listener, explicit authentication, and TLS present.
```


### c) Mixed-Use (conditional auth or server binding on config/env)

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-heuristic-mixed-use
  languages: [python]
  message: "Heuristic: MCP supports both trusted-host and public server modes (conditional on config/env)."
  severity: info
  patterns:
    - pattern-either:
        - pattern: |
            if os.environ.get("MCP_MODE") == "standalone":
                $SECURE = True
        - pattern: |
            if config.public_enabled:
                app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
        - pattern: |
            if $CONFIG.auth.enabled:
                # Apply auth middleware
        - pattern: |
            def $FUNC(..., $USER = Depends($AUTH_FUNC)):
    - pattern-not: |
        # No hard network binding without conditional
        app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
  metadata:
    deployment_mode: mixed-use
    explanation: |
      Detected support for switching between host-only (local/io) and public/external server operation, depending on environment or configuration.
```


## 2. Broad Authentication Pattern Matching

```yaml
- id: mcp-py-auth-detected
  languages: [python]
  severity: info
  message: "Authentication/RBAC logic detected."
  patterns:
    - pattern-either:
        # Classic Flask/Express
        - pattern: |
            if "Authorization" in request.headers:
        # FastAPI dependency-based
        - pattern: |
            def $FUNC(..., $USER = Depends($AUTH_FUNC)):
        # Config/middleware toggles
        - pattern: |
            if config.security.auth.enabled:
        # API key header
        - pattern: |
            api_key = request.headers.get("X-API-Key")
            if not validate_api_key(api_key):
        # Decorators/middleware
        - pattern: |
            @require_auth
        - pattern: |
            app.add_middleware(AuthMiddleware, ...)
```


## 3. Recommended Scanning Flow

- **Scan with these heuristics first** to tag the likely deployment mode for each MCP repo.
- **Run role-appropriate security/enforcement rules** (from your previous scoring/policy framework) based on detected mode(s).
- Adjust your findings, recommendations, and FICO scoring using the inferred mode, not manifest file presence.


## 4. General Notes

- **Pattern-either** blocks let you capture all the real-world ways fast-moving OSS MCP codebases implement (or skip) authentication, network binding, or deployment toggles.
- **You can add more language/framework tweaks** (e.g., for Tornado, Django, Starlette, etc.) as needed for your ecosystem.
- Heuristics can be refined and tuned as you see more production MCP repos.


## Summary Table

| Heuristic Detected | What it Means (for security policy/rules) |
| :-- | :-- |
| stdio-only, no server bind | trusted-host-only |
| network binding + auth | standalone |
| conditional/public toggles | mixed-use |
| no manifest, ambiguous code | fallback to strict/conservative rules |

**This approach makes Semgrep codebase-first, practical, and much more useful in modern MCP environments!**
You can further tune these patterns and logic as you see more deployment idioms in real-world MCP OSS.</assistant>

# So use the above rule first and the previous rules after, or do these replace the previous rules?

**Use the heuristic rules FIRST, then apply the prior (role-specific) security rules SELECTIVELY based on the detected deployment mode.**
These new heuristic rules do NOT replace your prior, role-specific security rules—they provide the “detection logic” to choose which ruleset to enforce for a given MCP repo.

## How to Combine the Rules

### 1. Heuristic Deployment Detection Comes First

- The new heuristic rules try to infer (by code pattern) if the repo is:
    - trusted-host-only
    - standalone
    - mixed-use
    - (or falls back to unknown/ambiguous)
- This replaces an unreliable reliance on manifest fields (like "role" in mcp.json) since, in practice, those files rarely exist.


### 2. Role-Specific Rules Apply Second

- Once a deployment mode is identified, your **role-specific Semgrep rules** (e.g., requiring auth or forbidding network listeners) should be enforced according to the detected mode.
    - E.g., If `trusted-host-only` is detected, only those rules run (no need to check for network exposure, but DO check for accidental server bind).
    - If `standalone` is detected, enforce full perimeter security (auth, TLS, rate limiting, etc.).
    - If `mixed-use`, enforce conditional rules (auth/TLS must be present in public mode).


### 3. Workflow Example:

1. **Run heuristic Semgrep rules:**
    - Detect which deployment context applies (trusted-host-only, standalone, mixed-use, etc.).
    - Output tag/result (can be saved to a variable, file, label).
2. **Run only the security rules for that role:**
    - Use your orchestration script (or next Semgrep run) to apply just the matching set of rules (as outlined in your previous “by-role” YAMLs).
    - This minimizes false positives, increases coverage, and more faithfully reflects real MCP deployment risks.
3. **Scoring/reporting:**
    - Plug the resulting findings into your FICO-style risk scoring model.

## Visual Summary

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Run Heuristic Role Detection Rules] --> B{Detected Mode?}
    B -->|trusted-host-only| C[Enforce Trusted-Host Rules]
    B -->|standalone| D[Enforce Standalone Rules]
    B -->|mixed-use| E[Enforce Mixed-Use Rules]
    B -->|unknown| F[Apply Conservative Defaults]
```

- The **heuristic detection set** is a "gateway" that determines which subsequent rule set should gate, warn, or score the repo.


## Why Not Just Use Role-Specific Rules Upfront?

Because without reliable manifest/config info, you don’t know which set applies—so you need code-based heuristics to infer the deployment context first.

**In summary:**

- The heuristic rules come first, guiding which role-specific security rules you run next.
- Do NOT replace your prior rules. Use both, chained:

1. Heuristic detection ⇒
2. Appropriate security rule group for detected role.
- This process makes your code security analysis robust and accurate in the real world, even if repos don’t follow manifest best practices.

# now give me the rules for javascript both pre and full

Certainly! Below you’ll find **two sets of Semgrep rules for MCP JavaScript/TypeScript projects**:

1. **Heuristic (pre) rules:**
These are broad detection rules that scan code for actual patterns (e.g., network listeners, auth, config toggles) to guess the deployment mode: `trusted-host-only`, `standalone`, or `mixed-use`.
These **replace manifest checking** since real repos rarely have one.
2. **Role-specific (full) rules:**
Once a repo's role is detected by the heuristics, you run only the relevant security rules for that role (auth checks for standalone, etc.).

**Summary:**

- Run the **heuristic "pre-rules"** first to infer the deployment mode from code (not manifests!).
- Then, **apply only the full security rules for the detected mode** (trusted-host-only, standalone, mixed-use).
- All patterns are broad enough for real-world repo variety and support both JavaScript and TypeScript.

Let me know if you need advanced rules for other JS frameworks (Nest, Fastify, etc.) or want these as YAML artefacts!

# now for GO

Certainly! Below are **role-heuristic (pre) detection rules and full role-specific Semgrep rules for MCP Go projects**. These follow the same approach as for Python and JavaScript/TypeScript:

- First: run **heuristics** to infer deployment mode (since Go MCP repos also rarely use a manifest for "role").
- Then: enforce only the relevant security rules for the detected mode (trusted-host-only, standalone, mixed-use).

> **All rules below use Semgrep’s YAML format, are annotated, and are practical for real-world Go MCP code.**

# ✅ Best Practice

- **Run the pre-rules (heuristics) first:** let these heuristically classify the MCP's deployment mode by analyzing patterns in real Go code.
- **Then, apply only the security rules for the inferred mode** (trusted-host-only, standalone, mixed-use) from the above.

> These patterns are broad and tuned for Go's stdlib idioms (net/http, exec, TLS, logging, etc.) and work well across real-world, non-manifested Go MCP repos.

Let me know if you want extra coverage for specific Go web frameworks (Gin, Echo, Fiber) or want these broken out into YAML files for direct Semgrep use!

# Key Improvements for MCP JavaScript/TypeScript Semgrep Rules

To ensure robust, real-world applicability across the MCP JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem, you should enhance your rules for:

## 1. Import Pattern Detection: CommonJS vs. ES6

**Current Limitation:**
The rules primarily target one import style (often CommonJS, e.g., `require(...)`), but MCP codebases use both CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`) and modern ES6+ module syntax (`import`, `export`).

**What to Add:**

- **Include patterns for both import styles.**
    - **CommonJS:** `const $MOD = require('$LIB');`
    - **ES6:** `import $MOD from '$LIB';` and named imports.

**Examples:**

```yaml
- pattern-either:
    - pattern: const $MOD = require('$LIB')
    - pattern: import $MOD from '$LIB'
    - pattern: import { $NAME } from '$LIB'
```

Use this wherever you match for module usage or initialization (e.g., for stdio packages, `child_process`, etc.).

## 2. TypeScript-Specific Patterns

**Current Limitation:**
Rules assume plain JavaScript. TypeScript allows additional constructs:

- Types, interfaces, generics
- Decorators (`@controller`, `@middleware`)
- Type-based dependency injection in frameworks

**What to Add:**

- **Decorator support:** E.g., route/auth patterns in NestJS or similar.

```yaml
- pattern: |
    @Controller($ROUTE)
    class $CLS { ... }
- pattern: |
    @UseGuards($AUTH_GUARD)
    $FUNC(...) { ... }
```

- **Parameter typing and generics in function signatures:**

```yaml
- pattern: |
    function $NAME($REQ: Request, $RES: Response) { ... }
- pattern: |
    ($REQ: Request, $RES: Response) => { ... }
```

- **Class property and method syntax for HTTP handlers/auth logic:**

```yaml
- pattern: |
    class $C {
        public $FN($REQ: Request, $RES: Response) { ... }
    }
```

- **Matched types in locations such as dependency injection or token validation:**

```yaml
- pattern: |
    constructor(private $AUTH: AuthService) { ... }
- pattern: |
    validateToken(token: string): boolean { ... }
```


## 3. Best Practice Enhancements

- **Expand file extension support:**
Ensure `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` are all matched in your config.
- **Add broad pattern-either blocks:**
When matching for standard libs (stdio, auth middleware, etc.), always check both import styles and TypeScript-related syntax, so your coverage is high regardless of MCP project conventions.
- **Test against real TypeScript frameworks:**
Try rules against NestJS, Fastify, or TypeORM MCP implementations to iron out any TypeScript edge cases.


## Summary Table

| Area | What to Add | Example Pattern Enhancements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Import Detection | Support CommonJS \& ES6/TS import styles | `require(...)`, `import ... from ...` |
| TypeScript Syntax | Decorators, types, class methods | `@Decorator`, `($REQ: Type, ...)`, classes |

**Bottom Line:**
Update every relevant detection (import, usage, handler, middleware/auth) to match both CommonJS and ES6/TypeScript paradigms, significantly boosting hit rate and MCP repo coverage—especially as real-world adoption of TypeScript and advanced JS patterns continues to rise.
